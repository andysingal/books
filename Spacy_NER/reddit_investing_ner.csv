t3_vsx6ko|1657132934|investing|Method to sell a stock a particular way|"I hope this is the right forum to post it. If not please direct me to the correct one. 

Most trading platforms like Robinhood etc, have the following selling triggers:
1. Limit Order
2. Trailing Stop Order
3. Stop Order
4. Stop Limit Order

Let’s say you purchased a stock for $10 and have a target price of $15 after which you would like to sell it. However if the stock keeps going up, you would like to be in on those gains too. 
The simple Limit Order will rob you of any gains after your target has reached. 

The Trailing stop Order will set a specified % below the current price keep increasing as the stock increases. It will trigger a sell if the stock price starts a downswing and goes below the trail price. 
This allows you to get any gains during the upswing and limit your downswing losses. 

However you want to hold the stock even if it goes down and only trigger a sell if it hits your target price but only AFTER it passes your target price and then goes down a % from the maximum. 

To illustrate what I’m talking about take the example I previously mentioned. After the stock hits your target price of $15 it continues to go up to $20 and then starts going down. Let’s say we specify a trailing stop % of 10%. This means the sell will be triggered when the stock reaches $18. 
This method is effectively combining the Limit Order and TrailingStop Order. 

Are there any exchanges/platforms that offer this method?"|1.0|6|0|6|['Order', 'Robinhood']

t3_vst23n|1657122359|investing|US job openings slip but employment remains to be solid|"By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer

Employers posted 11.3 million job openings at the end of May, the [Labor Department said Wednesday](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf), down from nearly 11.7 million in April. Job openings reached 11.9 million in March, the highest level on records dating back more than 20 years. There are nearly two job openings for every unemployed person, a sharp reversal from the historic pattern: Before the pandemic, there were always more unemployed people than available jobs.

The figures reflect the unusual nature of the post-pandemic economy: Inflation is hammering household budgets, forcing consumers to pull back on spending, and growth is weakening, heightening fears the [economy could fall into recession](https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-business-layoffs-prices-f899b5d7e989fbe748c4ff49e2ed6096). Yet companies are still scrambling to add workers. Demand has been particularly strong in travel- and entertainment-related services.

“*This is not what a recession looks like,” said Nick Bunker, director of economic research at employment website Indeed's Hiring Lab. “Clouds can move in quickly and darken the outlook for the U.S. labor market, but for now, the sun is still shining.*”

Americans are also far more likely to quit their jobs than before the pandemic, mostly for new jobs at higher pay, another trend that is pushing up incomes. The number of people quitting fell to 4.3 million in May, down about 60,000 from April and below a record 4.5 million last November, but still historically high.

Economists are closely monitoring the jobs opening figures for signs the labor market is cooling, which could bring down inflation. With companies posting so many available positions, they have also been raising pay and offering more benefits to attract and keep workers. Higher labor costs have, in turn, contributed to pushing up prices, with [inflation now at 40-year highs](https://apnews.com/article/key-inflation-report-highest-level-in-four-decades-c0248c5b5705cd1523d3dab3771983b4).

The Federal Reserve has targeted the nearly record-high job openings as evidence that the economy has overheated, and [is rapidly lifting the short-term interest rate](https://apnews.com/article/fed-interest-rates-inflation-be1b698e48327d3a33847be25aba3e3d) it controls to cool consumer and business spending. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hopes that weaker spending will reduce demand for workers, lower job openings and wage increases, and bring down inflation.

For now, labor demand remains strong. Last month, the government said that [employers added 390,000 jobs in May,](https://apnews.com/article/us-economy-jobs-report-493e18e85978b9655766ef3129d8d4f8) a healthy increase, while the unemployment rate stayed at 3.6%, near a 50-year low.

There are signs that hiring and the demand for labor may cool in the coming months. On Friday, the June jobs report is expected to show that employers added 275,000 jobs, which would be a solid increase but the smallest in more than a year.  And Homebase, a company that provides payroll and hiring software for small businesses, says it has seen a 16% drop in new job postings by its customers in June compared with May. A separate survey of 400 of its clients finds that while most plan to add jobs this year, the proportion who say they won’t add jobs has doubled to 8% in June compared with January of this year. And the proportion who plan to add more than 11 workers has fallen sharply, to nearly 19%, down from 30% in January.

And a survey of executives at manufacturing firms found that last month new orders actually declined compared with May, as Americans cut back their spending on manufactured goods. Yet a separate survey Wednesday of restaurants, banks, and other companies that provide services showed growth remained solid."|0.86|70|0|70|"['May,](https://apnews.com', 'highs](https://apnews.com', 'The Federal Reserve', 'Fed', 'Labor Department', ""Indeed's Hiring Lab"", 'AP Economics Writer\n\nEmployers']"
t3_vsq47o|1657114296|investing|Yield Curve Inverted.... Again|"Probably not a surprise, but wanted to share this for discussion points. Given, the initial and brief inversion in April 2022 garnered most of the attention, but I personally think this one will get a bit deeper unless the Fed immediately walks back some rhetoric. Keep in mind, the inversion in April occurred before the Fed had even started to raise interest rates. It was more or less off the back of traders selling short-dated bonds in advance of the hiking cycle, and doing so more than they ever had before. 

Typically the long dated end of the curve starts to call out the fed's bluff during a hiking cycle as growth starts to slow down, which ***may*** be what's happening right now. 

As for inevitable discussions of recession and lag time from inversions, keep in mind that statistically, there is a wide window in which markets may or may not react to an inversion. In the Dotcom bubble, there was a secondary inversion that occurred right as the tech market topped in March of 2000. Recession didn't occur until later, but for the purpose of investors trying not to lose money, the inversion essentially top-ticked markets. On the other hand, the initial GFC inversion occurred over 2 years before the 2008 meltdown. It persisted in being negative for quite some time after the initial inversion, which may have played a role in reducing lending activity."|0.91|313|0|313|['Dotcom', 'fed', 'Fed']

I understand how a market for commodities is important, how a market for currencies is important too, really based on real economic activity.

I can understand that a company will want investors to take risks for them, through an IPO, and reward the investors with dividends.

But once the funds have been used, once the project of the company has been released.

What is the point of still having a stock? How does a company benefit from it? This sounds like long term enslavement for me.

Sure it can act as an ""incentive"" for the company to be efficient and good at what they do.
But by definition a company offering their stock no longer have stocks to sell so they cannot raise money once the IPO has ended.

And if the company happen to have stocks to sell, raising money will dump the market. But anyway after that the company won't have more stocks to sell. And if they create more stock, diluting the value of existing stocks, then dividends will not really make up for the losses, which is a fairly clunky system for everyone.

Why wouldn't companies make multiple IPOs instead, each time they want money raised?

I typically use collars and occasionally protective puts as a hedge. But I write naked puts and calls regularly. 

In the quarterly consultation with my new tax accountant, it was suggested I need to be careful about matching up naked calls with long puts on substantially identical underlying so that it can't be considered a synthetic short and violate the spirit of the rule.

t3_vroq5s|1656992356|investing|A question about stock price factors|"Hello everyone, I am an economics student, and I am currently personally studying the mechanisms of the stock market.

I am struggling to understand the connection between reported company earnings and the price of a stock.

To the best of my understanding a quarterly improvement on reported earnings for a company will theoretically rise the price of a stock, but I want to know why?

Is it simply because people will be less confident to invest in a company with falling earnings in fear that they will go bankrupt, thus lowering demand, or is it related to the estimates of economists influencing consumer sentiment?
I say this because recently poorly performing companies such as gamestop have seen huge stock price boosts, while companies reporting much more consistent and strong earnings have seen no where near that level of prosperity.

TLDR; What is the link between company earnings and stock prices?

Another Chinese real estate investment missed payment. So just how bad is this. I mean, evergrande seem to have fall out of news for no reason. 

People have been predicting Chinese real estate collapse for over a decade. Now for some context, in that time, chinas economy has continued to grown to the envy of the world. 

Now, specifically for Chinese real estate, let’s look at some incredible numbers. The real estate debt has grown to now accounting for over 40% of all debt obligation. China’s national debt to gdp went from barely 30% to now over 80%. Also, 64% of all local government revenue are funded by real estate development vehicle and land lease and real estate account for over 70% of household net wealth. Over 90% of all Chinese MBS are rated AA or higher. 

As of late, the government is reducing required initial payment for home purchase, contemplating allowing 40 year mortgage, and opening up private individually directed retirement fund. 

So either China has figured out a way to keep milking the real estate growth for seemingly forever, or we are looking at a house of card with a inevitable collapse that will make the MBS financial crisis in 2009 looking like a relative minor hiccup."|0.92|609|0|609|['MBS']

t3_vqumaz|1656893301|investing|Thoughts on small cap value tilts?|"Since 1926, US small cap value stocks have significantly outperformed the US total market. The annual CAGR for US small cap value since 1926 is 12.5%, compared to 10.5%^(1) for the S&amp;P 500 (before inflation).

Increasingly, investors are advised to invest in a portfolio of market indexes, such as the S&amp;P 500 (US large cap blend) and total market indexes.

Some investors avoid small cap value stocks (and small cap growth stocks) due to worries about higher risks and volatility. Historically, this fear is not completely unjustified as small cap value stocks are more volatile, with a standard deviation of 18% compared to 15% in the S&amp;P 500 since 1976. However, surprisingly (while more volatile) small cap value has shown higher Sortino/Sharpe ratios than the S&amp;P 500 over the last 50 years, possibly indicating better risk-adjusted returns^(2).

A number of studies and research highlight this long term outperformance, including the well known works of Fama and French^(3).

Some questions:
* Is the higher risk nature of small cap value the reason investors avoid this tilt, instead generally having a preference large cap/total market?
* Would this meet the typical idea of ""performance-chasing""?
* If investing with a specific tilt such as small cap value is considered ""performance-chasing"" even when scientific research has shown improved returns over 100 years, why then is investing in the total market not ""performance-chasing"". People invest in the stock market because they believe it will return a long term CAGR of around 7% (because it has historically), aren't they ""chasing"" that return as it is not guaranteed and treasuries for example would return a smaller but less ""speculative"" return? Where's the boundary of ""performance-chasing""?
* Why do you believe small cap value has outperformed?
* Why shouldn't I have small cap value indexes as a main part of my long term portfolio?
* Is there a systematic problem investing in small cap value, am I missing some obvious downside?

t3_vqp6u5|1656876868|investing|Do interest rate cuts tend to lead to bull or bear markets?|"I’ve seen conflicting info. Links in the text

For example, Patrick Boyle [presented](https://youtu.be/0jxoVSUSHg0) [skip to 15:30] very convincing and sourced information that shows that an investor investing money at the beginning of the interest rate cut will do much better in terms of equity returns than during interest rate hikes (in the US) and the in the UK all off the equity premium was earned during interest rate cuts only. This is very convincing information based on study looking at a 130 year period in the Uk and USA

On the other hand I’ve seen often quoted stat, as below in the link presented by day trading YouTube channel “FX Evolution” (unfortunately unsourced) that the previous [5 out of 7 times](https://youtu.be/eXuXiTdr6vM) [skip to 11:30] the Fed has cut the rates this has lead to a recession - in fact it is cutting after the hikes which is the most dangerous part. Unfortunately there’s no good source of this information, except for a video like above of articles mentioning that previous hike and cut cycles have led to bad results, however I have not across well researched articles on this. I was not able to find anything useful further online. 

Although it is not strictly contradictory - positive equity returns can happen during recessions like during Covid, I don’t think that’s the norm. And if recessions commonly happened during rate cuts there would probably not be a such a noticeable positive equity return as the market tend to fall during recessions. 

So which one of these is true? Do interest rate cuts tend to lead recessions/bear markets or economic booms/bull markets?

The remainder of the cryptocurrency project that Meta Platforms Inc.’s Founder Mark Zuckerberg took a beating over from Congress is officially shutting down. Meta’s Novi pilot—a money-transfer service using the company’s own cryptocurrency digital wallet—will end on Sept. 1, the service said on its website, a link to which it texted to its users. Both the Novi app and Novi on WhatsApp will no longer be available, the company said on the Website. Starting July 21, users will no longer be able to add money to their accounts, Novi said, advising users to withdraw their balance “as soon as possible.” Users won’t be able to access their transaction history or other data after the pilot ends. The company does plan to use Novi’s technology in future products, such as in its metaverse project, a company spokesperson said in an email. “We are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,” Meta said in the statement. “You can expect to see more from us in the web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.”

The stock has been cut by more than half in 2022. Although Wall Street has been in a buying mood last week, real world pressures continue to make META stock one to avoid. Alternatively, if investors can’t help but like META stock at current prices, I’d similarly point to a long vertical spread using call contracts or a fully hedged collar for those interested in owning shares. But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.

Meta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels’ inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta’s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.

How is adding 100 new employees and building a 15,000sq ft addition bullish. 


Its not its mixed and that's what the price action reflected or it would of ran over 515-525 range. 


1. The addition was already built when the news came out on nov 1 2021. (150sqft per person - 15,000sq ft at $80-125 square ft =1.2 -1.8 Mil investment call it 1.5 -2Mil)


 2. They've been slowly switching there model from sales over phone in 2017-18 to online sales with support. So from 1 to 1 customer to employee ratio now its more like - 10 -20 customers to 1.0001 employees (0.0001 is for IT, 1 per 1000 customer service agents). More agents mean faster orders and more orders per day. And this is what exactly reflected on q1 of earnings release, sales per day was up 18%.


 Add the amazing 1st quarter results increasing forward outlook on the year and EPS range from 23.50-25.50 to 25.00 -27.00. Everything increased from sales up 18%,  margins up 15% and outstanding shares decreased.  I've already wagered that the low is in here at 440.50 -11%. I can see them doing 20% year end or around 600 per share.  Disclaimer: This stock carries alot of momentum once it starts going it really moves. 


To note: The company owns pretty much a monopoly in its sector accounting for nearly 50% by market cap. Its main competitor fast is on nasdaq but wwgrainger still has a much different model and consumer. So its really in league of its own.

So I have been told by many people (including a Fidelity financial advisor that we get a free consultation with as part of my job) that Roth 401k is the better path vs a traditional 401k if available, especially when younger.

That being said, I also have heard a counter argument that seems to also make sense: specifically, it is that Roth 401k contributions are not the best path because they are taxed at your top marginal rate. So as an example, if you make around $100k a year, your Roth 401k contribution is functionally taxed at a marginal rate of 24%. If you were to contribute to a traditional 401k, though, then you would not only be able to put more money into it at the present time to grow, but you would also then withdraw the money at an effective rate below that 24% top marginal rate. I also realize that Roth gains are untaxed, though, which makes this even more confusing since that might make Roth superior to Traditional.

So I guess my question in all this is if anyone has a recommendation or good rule of thumb (based on age or anything else) on when it is best to put money into a Roth vs traditional 401k?"|0.65|12|0|12|['Fidelity']

I'm not sure exactly what number to cherrypick from what report to get the conversation started here.

Obviously, most of us are not professional analysts, so we are pretty far from ""the best person for the job"" when it comes to giving an educated opinion on such a robust economic topic.

2021 earnings: 208.49

2022 earnings estimate: 225

2023 earnings estimate: 240

Why are S&amp;P earnings estimated to grow 8% from 2021 -&gt; 2022, and 6.66% 2022 -&gt; 2023? If markets are forward looking... why does it feel like there's still a bit of wiggle room for future earnings estimates to be adjusted downwards? Why are markets being optimistic instead of pessimistic?

I pulled up the top 100 companies of the S&amp;P by earnings TTM (not EPS, EPS * # shares outstanding). Top 100 companies make up 65% of the market cap and 73% of the earnings for the S&amp;P500

Building stock portfolios seemed a bit scary to me as I don't do this for a living and i worried somewhat about divesifying, however, the reality is you don't need 500 stocks to diverisfy - 15-20 can do it. Plus, i have a day job so i don't have time to deep dive into more than 10 or so companies (again, i don't do this for a living!).  This seemed fine to me...until I took a holistic view of what I was buying..and realized i was pretty concentrated in certain sectors or regions..which were somewhat highly correlated!  

So i switched over to ETFs and suprisingly, my performance has been better than my individual stock picks - even over short time periods.  I focus more on macro-level drivers, and less on which company within a certain sector/region/theme, etc.  

I also evaluated using a robo-advisor, but that just felt too detatched.   I want to be somewhat involved, for better or worse.  I never even considered a financial advisor - I just think their fees are way too high and I didn't love their value add or service for certain family members that had bad experiences and outcomes.  

I'm guessing there are people in both camps (ETFs vs stock pickers), but i'm cuirious - how has your experiences gone?  Its been a bit of a journey for me, but ETFs just seem better suited for someone like me who doesn't focus on stocks all day/everyday."|1.0|4|0|4|['ETFs']

My (very likely faulty) logic: Greece never recovered from the 2008 recession and we bailed the country out but not without repercussions. This time around the rate hikes might be too much and break the back of several, even bigger economies than that of Greece. Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Greece are eurozone countries and all of those are not in the best shape and their GDP has not recovered from the 2008 crash. I consider them to be zombie economies, stagnating, barely able to reinvent themselves. Almost no room to grow, only down from here.

&gt;Tesla has held about 70 percent of the EV market share in recent years. That is forecast to drop to a mere 11 percent over the next four years, says John Murphy, the Bank of America analyst behind the annual Car Wars report that looks at the auto industry and predicts which companies are on a winning path and which are not.

&gt;Musk's apparent idea that the supposedly unsophisticated auto industry didn't know how to manufacture came back to bite him when he learned firsthand how hard it is to make cars, learned that those legacy techniques work, and was forced to adopt them. ""That was a big miss on his part,"" Murphy says.

I have said before that I won't touch Tesla stock either way, because underestimating has proven a mistake, even in the face of obvious headwinds... but other manufacturers are releasing _135 EV models_ over the coming years, so something is going to stick. We've already seen demand exceeding supply for the F150 and Mach E.

&gt;""He is launching new product at a slower rate, he does not have a full product portfolio, so there is a huge opportunity for other competitors to shoot the gap and catch up,""

Tesla does not have a real SUV, they have hatchbacks. There is a huge market miss there. They don't have a truck, and that is a _huge_ moneymaker for auto manufacturers. They don't have anything compact or ""cheap.""

It's important to note after all of this that the share of cars being EV is increasing, so even with falling market share expect their production to increase. But I don't think it's going to be 90% of the market as some Tesla bulls predict.

Tesla's EV market share in Europe declined from 31% in 2019 to 13% in 2020. Last month it was 10% market share. A declining share can happen."|0.91|1734|0|1734|['https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-general-motors-ford-shares-analysis-car-wars/\n\n&gt;Tesla', 'the Bank of America']

https://picbun.com/p/Vt7FUncq 


I'm building an excel spreadsheet with my current expenses and adding in estimated future expenses such as more home help, cleaning, yard work maybe etc, I won't always be able to be diy guy. I'm also estimating Healthcare costs and insurance as well as travel/vacation.


But do I need to be inflation adjusting these expenses in order to match up with where I'm projecting my portfolio growth to be in 10 to 15 years from now?



If I use today's estimated costs for things I'll need in 15 years from now when I may reach FI and potentially RE will my numbers be somewhat accurate? Or will they be way off?


I'm also guessing that $1200 per month can get my wife and I health insurance with maybe a 6k deductible. 

And I'm estimating that after 10 to 15 years we'll refinance the house and will owe less per month than current. 155k owed currently. Probably 100k owed in 10 years if we make a few extra payments here and there. 

I see s&amp;p500 is 10.5 percent annual returns before inflation adjustment and 7 percent adjusted. I assume 7 percent is the number I would use. 


Do I use a compound interest calculator for these growth projections? I know it's not a CD or a bond so I didn't know if compound calculator was the choice for this sort of investment. 



What savings goal should I realistically set? I'm not looking to nail it down to an exact number but I'd like to know if I'm in the right ballpark with my estimates. I keep coming up with between 1.8M and 2.5M depending on how I project my expenses. But if I need to be projecting my future inflation adjusted expenses then my numbers are too low... 



 I'm aiming for 28X my annual spending because I'll be a bit less than 50 years old when I may start reaching these portfolio values needed. So need to get 50 years out of the portfolio.

When we strip out volatile food and energy costs, we get a “core” headline PCE read of +0.3%, 10 basis points (bps) below what analysts were expecting. This tells us the inflation pain was mostly on the food and energy side last month. Duh.

&gt; What most inflation-watchers, including the Fed, pay close attention to are the year-over-year PCE numbers, and here we’re pretty close to expectations as well: +6.3% on headline (in-line with estimates) and +4.7% on core (+4.8% expected, +4.9% in April). Of course, PCE data is drawn from a series of other economic inputs released previously, so surprises are usually modest at best.

&gt; Where we see some real mashing of the fruit last month is in the Income/Spending areas: while Personal Income gained +0.5% as expected, Real Personal Consumption posted a big drop-off: -0.4% versus a downwardly revised +0.3% the previous month.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/larry-summers-nailed-inflation-but-is-he-right-on-what-comes-next-11656343688

In February 2021, Larry Summers was right and I was wrong. The former Treasury secretary warned that President Biden’s stimulus package was far too large and would lead to far too high inflation. I was less worried and thought the Federal Reserve would be willing to raise interest rates to head off any inflationary problem. My faith was misplaced, and it took me until June to realize my mistake. The Fed waited another nine months to act.

Markets are finally focused on whether the Fed’s newfound hawkishness will start a recession—Prof. Summers thinks it will. There is a longer-term question that matters, too: Once inflation is finally brought under control, do we return to the post-2009 secular stagnation, or will there be a new paradigm? Here again I find myself disagreeing with Prof. Summers, who thinks the likelihood is we return to the status quo ante.

The question is far from academic for anyone thinking about how to position their portfolio in future years. A return to the miserable growth and excess savings of the decade before the pandemic sets up the same trade that prospered for years: long everything that benefits from the Fed going back to loose money. That would mean buying expensive technology stocks, bonds and private assets and ignoring cheap, economically sensitive cyclical stocks.

Prof. Summers set out the case over a late-afternoon dish of cured salmon at a London hotel.

“It’s 60-40 that we’re going back to something that’s kind of secular stagnation,” he said. Just as in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 recession, interest rates will be held down by increased savings resulting from an aging population and the uncertainty that comes after a crisis. Rapid technological development will again keep the cost of capital goods down. More savings and less investment means lower after-inflation interest rates are required to balance the economy.

He sees the threat of recession, even with 10-year bond yields at just over 3%, as strong evidence that he is right that the U.S. and the world can’t cope with higher rates.

“The fact that such low rates seem to be causing a recession is quite prohibitive,” he argues.

Anyways, theoretically, there is probably some exact percentage of leverage that would maximize returns over the long term without blowing up your account, and taking you out of the game completely. Not using leverage at all seems unnecessary (if you don't need withdrawals), because the chances of the market going to 0 are low, and in a scenario where the market goes to 0 you'll probably have bigger things to worry about.

**Total return bond index futures**

Is there a corresponding set of products for bonds/notes/bills total return indices? Looking for a product that allows:

1. performance that would mimic the interest/coupons plus the price changes of the underlying fixed income assets with interest/coupons and price changes built right into the futures price, like they are for stock index futures

 HP dividend yield is 2.83% (according to google).

To me his actions don't make sense. 

Lets say if I have $100,000 to invest.

In the past people paid $100,000 to get 8% return (lets say in 2001), then paid $100,000 to get 5% return (lets say 2010), now recently people have been paying 100,000 to let a lousy 3% return (lets say 2020)

So if I am someone who invests for say income, for $100,000 I would have got $8,000, in 2001.

So in 2020, I would need around $270,000 to get around the same $8000.

If stock prices have been going up, because people have been chasing every lower returns e.g. 8% -&gt; 5% and now 3%    (largely because interest rates were going down)

The reason for people accepting lower returns is because interest rates kept falling, so people were okay with lower returns. 

Does that mean stock prices have fall, to entice investor to put money in those stocks?. If HP is paying 2.83%, I would want the stock price to fall, so that my return is say around 6%. 

As bank interest rates are rising, why would people put money in stock.

So for me, I would hold to cash, until returns improve?

What is Berkshire Hathaway seeing that I am not?

Sorry I have done bad job in explaining what I am trying to ask, but hopefully it will make sense to someone and may be they can re-write it or explain it in a simpler form?

It's not a high end restaurant backed by a michelin starred/celebrity chef or anything, it's being opened by a group of 4 friends and will probably be in the $$ price range.

What I'm sensing though is that food prices are going through the roof. I think beef alone is up 30% this year and I see many restaurants struggling and closing right now as fewer people go out to eat due to real economic slowdown and perceived fears of further inflation and economic recession.

They seem to think that it's a good time to open a restaurant because renting a space is cheap... but it's cheap because of mass vacancies which can't be good for restaurants either, right?

To clarify - historically, it seems like many large cap stocks used to grow more steadily over the past few decades, doubling let's just say every 5 years on average. Obviously tech stocks grew much faster and there's been overall fluctuations in the market and plenty of outliers. But if I pull up any random major (non-Tech) corporation from the S&amp;P 500 that has existed since the 90s, they (more often than not) were growing at a fairly steady rate when you exclude broader market trends like the 2008 recession. 

That is, until post-COVID when everything went nutso. You could argue that the pace for many of them picked up even before that around 2016. 

So my curiosity is in trying to determine where these share prices would be if those broad market dips and recent rapid growth were normalized over the same time period. I'm not even sure that would be all that useful, but I think it would be interesting to see that growth in a vacuum (so to speak).

TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --&gt; $3750 --&gt; $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --&gt; higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. 

Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car. Union labor is way, way more expensive than Mexican labor. 7500 alone is a huge moat to cross when you're not profitable with that 7500 subsidy."|0.79|506|0|506|['CFO', 'EPA', 'Mach E.

Lets say I buy 100 shares from Apple for 130$. Apple reaches 150$ and I sell all my shares.

I withdraw the money and take it to my bank account.

1st Question: how does that affect Apple's cash flow? Do they lose 15000 from their liquid cash or from where does that money get deducted?

(Bloomberg) -- On trading floors in New York and Hong Kong, the brightening mood toward Chinese technology companies is unmistakable: With stocks like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. surging from multi-year lows, talk of a new bull market is growing louder.

When speak to executives, entrepreneurs and venture capital investors intimately involved in China’s tech sector and a more downbeat picture emerges. Interviews with more than a dozen industry players suggest the *outlook is still far from rosy, despite signs that the Communist Party’s crackdown on big tech is softening at the edges.*

These insiders describe an ongoing sense of paranoia and paralysis, along with an unsettling realization that the sky-high growth rates of the past two decades are likely never coming back.

Alibaba (Baba) and Tencent  are expected to *deliver* ***single-digit revenue growth in 2022***\*, a letdown after years of rip-roaring expansion.\* One prominent startup founder said he’d pass on money from those companies because of the attention it would attract. Another said his company is proceeding on the assumption that it’s only a matter of time before officials double down again.

A third Beijing-based entrepreneur recently sold his stake in a tech unicorn and said he’s reluctant to start a new venture until there’s more clarity on what the government will allow.

“China’s tech crackdown has happened. There is no comeback from that,” the entrepreneur said, asking to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. “The regulatory pressure on Chinese tech companies may have hit the brakes for now, given the sluggish economy, but it’s unthinkable that regulators in the country would loosen their grip on platform companies ever again.”"|0.68|30|0|30|['Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.', 'China’s Tech Giants', 'Tencent Holdings Ltd.', 'Tencent', 'the Communist Party’s']

I'm looking for a strategy to invest a large sum of money over 18 months.   


It looks like I'm getting priced out of the housing market with these rate hikes. So my plan is to  invest heavily in the stock market over the next year and a half. I'll be using my down payment and most of my pay check every month.   


My time frame is based on the average bear market being roughly 1 year and recovery being roughly 2 years. Along with DCA, I would also buy dips of a certain percentage, like 2% or something. So I expect my real time frame to be between 1 and  1.5 years.   


I want to DCA the down payment into a growth portfolio like VTI and QQQ. So this would leave a large portion as cash in the beginning that would shrink as I invest. I want to do something productive with the unspent cash.    


I was thinking of doing a second smaller DCA along side the growth DCA. The second smaller DCA would be a value/dividend portfolio. I would DCA into it over 12 months and DCA out over 12 months to get long term capital gains tax rates. I would start to exit the value portfolio only if I was in the green and then DCA into the growth portfolio.   


I'm building a spread sheet to work out the details. But I was hoping for constructive criticism or advice.   


Is my plan a good one? Are there better strategies? Any and all input is welcome.

Many people on here say to stick to US stock, if they do suggest international it’s always only 20-30% allocation.

My question is why?

In the long term, world ex US stocks on average make 10% returns while US stocks do too.

So I’m medium terms one may beat the other but overall they both go up by the same long term.

Wouldn’t that make it prudent to go 50/50 then?

Or better yet, by the logic that they both grow 10% long term but one beats the other short term, the fact that US has beat international short to medium term should mean 75/25 going heavy international no?

t3_vjbd4l|1656030497|investing|How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?|"**How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?**

Is there a stock as ridiculously underpriced as Citi (C)? Before the 2007-2008 crisis, Citi was trading at around $500/share and then abruptly crashed down to prices as low as $15/share before moderately rebounding to around $40/share in late 2009. Since 2009, Citi has been trading within the range of $40-$80/share despite enormous growth in the company's financials. Citi currently trades at roughly $50/share despite yielding annual free cash flows (FCFs) which are far, far, far greater than they ever did when its stock price was roughly $500/share. They had FCFs of \~$57 billion in 2021! And the 2022 Q1 report makes the rest of the year look extremely promising. If you took their Q1 2022 Net Income, ""extrapolated"" that figure for the entirety of 2022 by multiplying it by 4, and assumed the same Net Income/Free Cash Flow ratio as seen in 2021, you'd get a FCF number equal to around $44 billion! Both their actual 2021 FCF figure and this 2022 estimate are drastic improvements from prior years. But keep in mind that this ""back-of-the-envelope"" estimation calculation is most likely an underestimation for one big reason:

**RISING INTEREST RATES**

Banks make more money when interest rates rise. The Fed is raising and will continue to raise interest rates to recent records to combat the recent bout of inflation. Banks such as Citi stand to gain enormously from this.

Yet for some reason, the Fed's announcement of interest rate hikes in March barely had an effect on Citi's stock.

EDIT: Additionally, Warren Buffett recently invested an enormous amount in Citi, but that had very little effect on its stock price.

Every single DCF model I've seen of Citi yield Equity/Share values that are far, far, far higher than what the stock is currently trading for. Analysts widely seem to agree that Citi is undervalued and has been for several years.

Just for fun, I took the Free Cash Flows generated by Citi from 1989-2021 and used the Excel forecast function to use that data to create a forecast for the next 10 years within a 95% confidence interval. Thereafter, I took those FCF forecasts and used the ""terminal value"" method to come up with a NPV Enterprise value for the company (assuming a 5.5% WACC, as calculated by valueinvesting.io). I took this figure and subtracted the company's net debt to arrive at an equity value for the company. Afterward, I divided this equity value and divided it by Citi's shares outstanding. This is essentially how DCF models calculate a stock's ""intrinsic"" price. I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$254.68/share.**

But that's not all! I also did the same thing but used the FCF forecasts from the Lower Confidence Bound (meaning Excel is 95% sure that the actual values will be higher than these values). Thereafter, I averaged the results from the median forecast and the worst-case scenario (as it is extremely unlikely that Citi will actually yield FCF of around -$35 billion for every single year for the next 10 years). Averaging the median forecasts and the worst-case forecasts, I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$56.55/share**! Keep in mind that this is basically the most realistic **worst-case scenario** for Citi's future FCFs.

**Citi is currently trading at $46.35/share.**

I've done tons of DCF models and my ""intrinsic value"" figure always ends up being pretty close to the actual stock price. This is virtually the only exception. How on Earth is Citi only trading at $46.35/share!? How is that even possible!?

Personally, I never see a reason to invest in bonds when you're young, but would love to be proven wrong.

When rates go down, Bond ETF distributions go down but prices go up, when rates go up distributions go up but prices go down.

Thus, for a young aristocrat dividend growth investor there is *never* a scenario where bond prices *and* distributions go up, whereas dividend aristocrats in any decade - some decades stocks did poorly I know, but that's not what I'm asking - never had a decade where *overall* they didn't grow dividends and shares at least broke even more or less right?

t3_vipck1|1655962063|investing|a simple approach to company research /|"Hi there, 

for all the impatient:   
TLTR:   
here´s my approach: 

I look at a company in a sector that interests me or meets a certain criteria I set myself. 

then I take a look at a chart : stock price. then I zoom out , AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. depending on the tool I use, I try to see the complete history of the stock price ever since it was issued on one page. 

why do I do this ? because if it started trading 20+ years ago, the company already had to weather certain crisis, and major changes in local and global market situations. 

it changed leadership and strategy probably more than once. 

and it is something we can see exactly mirrored if you look at an index like the S&amp;P.

you see major dips for all black swan events that ever happened. and you see if it was able to bounce back at all. 

and depending on how the chart reacted to those events in time, I decide on putting it on my watchlist and eventually buy in. no matter the price. because long term, the company has proven to be resilient to basically all changes in markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

that´s it. 

let me know if this is just too simple. so far, it has worked extremely well.

and this is the topic I would love to get your opinions on and please keep in mind: I am solely talking about ""INVESTING"" -&gt; long term buying and holding of equity. no ""plays"", daytrading or any fancy ""make money fast"" approach. 

&amp;#x200B;

  


thank you guys.   


\--------------------------

*here comes the part where I try to explain WHY I am doing it this way. its optional to read.* 

as I am getting older, the more I realize the mistakes I made when I was young. 

when I started out, I was chasing ""opportunities"" to make as much money as fast as possible. I was gullible enough to listen to ""tips"" , invest in stocks that were extremely volatile, without any real clue what I was doing. 

fast forward 30 years. I would say I have a decent amount of life experience. I have a pretty good job that pays well. and since I got older, my approach to investing changed. 

even though I read several books about ""fundamental business analysis"", and several books about ""how to invest"", more and more I come to the conclusion that it´s all ""made up"". 

unless you have an extremely good understanding of what is really going on, any investment choice is directly correlated to risk  of at least freezing cash in a non-moving equity. given enough timeframe though, and given enough ""distance"", this can be mitigated.

one of the most common advice I read and see again and again is ""invest in good companies with strong fundamentals and a proven business model"".

now, you COULD start digging into financial reports.quarterly earnings and shareholder news. 

BUT: this will always and only tell you about the PAST. the more complex a business is, the more it is interconnected with international supply and value chains and markets, the harder it becomes to actually , even semi-realistically, predict future performance. 

in my personal opinion: most scenarios are way too complex for even the smartest people.   
there´s this saying that NO Investor / trader beat index investing in the long run. (barren a teeny tiny few exceptions. those are statistical anomalies, not the norm. most of them also started investing and trading WAY back when, when information wasn´t as easily available AND supply and value chains weren´t as complex and fast moving as they are now. 

&amp;#x200B;

anyways: since its hard to predict and foresee how even the best business will do in any given timeframe, I started to dumb down my research approach. 

we have plenty of data available about the past. and from an investor perspective, its all good, but the one thing that is the most important factor overall is not EBIT, cashlow, debt ratio or whatever:  its how share prices moved and developed. (and hopefully will develop)."|0.63|5|0|5|[]

Hear me out, we’ve been in a decades long slump in interest rates. Lower and lower and lower and lower.

The impact of this is that ETF bond distributions have been on a decade long slump. Do you think we could see a reversal such that your distributions would actually *increase* in the way dividend aristocrats increase their dividends every year thereby becoming the new “dividend growth” strategy but with coupons from bond ETF distributions instead?

Before you say no way we will in long term continue to lower rates in order to keep the machine going after every crisis, but what if there’s another way?

Instead of relying on rates, we instead increase or cut taxes to keep money in circulation or “suck it out” of the system whenever we need to prevent deflation spiral.

We cut debts to increase pent up demand.

We print money to increase inflation *in times where we want to prevent deflationary spirals*.

Finally, albeit controversial, we consider a CBDC which will cap consumption on goods that are inflating too much and offer benefits like more CBDC on things that are deflating too much.

All this happens while interest rates creep up in the background for the next  decades, thereby having coupons going up and up and as a result bond ETF distributions increasing as well.

I was hoping someone more familiar with the ruling could confirm or correct my interpretation of the window during which a trade might be subject to the wash sale rule. I have interpreted it as such:

* 30 days prior to a trade;
* 30 days following a trade;

This would be a 60-day window. However, it also seems that the *day of* a trade would also fall within that window such that the total would be 61 days as such:

* 1 day of the trade
* 30 days following the trade;

As such, this would prevent the 1-day period, the ""day of,"" the trade, from being considered either *before* or *after* the trade.

When I bought it I was single, and I sort of knew that if I got into a serious relationship I would want to sell for something bigger, but it was the max I could afford. I got into a relationship and it just wasn't practical for both of us to work from home in that condo. Then some family stuff happened and we realized if I didn't sell now I'd probably need to sell later this year (which would likely be worse).

We're hoping to use some of the equity I've built to get us into a bigger place where we can both live and work comfortably, and maybe start a family (I'm 30).

It worked out. But I feel like the last 2 weeks during this sale process I've been pretty difficult to be around. I've been stressed as hell, incredibly anxious, no appetite, disconnected... The idea of not being able to sell when I want to sell, and being trapped did a number on me. The market going ice cold the week I listed made it even worse. I got something close to the result I wanted but only now am I coming out of it realizing how awful the experience was.

Anyways, I realize that short-mid term investing is probably not for me. The stakes feel so high and the margin for error feels so low. It's perfect anxiety-inducing conditions and I'm a pretty anxious person I guess...

I've been tracking an infraestructure corporation (OHLA) which trades at the Spanish Stock Exchange.

Past year, they raised capital to reshuffle their financial structure and a couple of Mexican brothers took it over and now they own 26% of the equity (they haven't discarded buying more).   It was involved in corruption cases and the previous owners mismanaged it... but now it is completely clean.

Past year OHLA earned money for first time in five years, and first quarter this year they had a small loss (but a profit on operating income).

This year has been a nightmare for OHLA as it has lost more than 40% of its value after rallying the first day of January. They are being awarded lots of public contracts (even several New York underground stations were built by them) and apart from infraestructure, OHLA also designs and builds power plants and solar panels, among other business segments.

It trades at 0.59x price to book value and 0.13x price to sales and 0.66x debt to equity ratio.

Probably a huge bonanza for banks since they can invest that same money easily and safely at almost 1 percent higher.

EDIT and as one commenter pointed out, you need to hold to maturity of 1 year for both Treasuries and CDs to get the full return. Unlike CDs you originated at a bank you don't get 100% face value/par back if you sell early, which makes sense since you are buying them at a discount, which represents all or part of the return in addition to interest, if any.

**Shams, Shakedowns, &amp; Swindles**

When I read through the [list of confidence tricks on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_confidence_tricks) I’m struck by the boundless creativity that humans posses.  I imagine the millions of variations of scams and schemes that must have existed over the [lifetimes of 100 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population), and marvel at our ingenuity when it’s applied to making a quick buck.

From papyrus to protocols, the undiscovered country of criminality lies along the frontiers of new technology.  Ethical borders are easily crossed, and moral compasses ignored, when opportunity is plentiful and law is scarce.  Outright theft has always been relatively straightforward, but risky.  Why take by force what the gullible and guileless will volunteer?  Patience is a virtue, and the long con is where the big money is at.

Fraud’s foundations lie in the marriage of dishonesty and exploitation.  Beyond this, its taxonomy is arbitrary.  Many choose to assign fraud to a [category based on the specific goal or mechanism used](https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumers-and-communities/consumer-protection/fraud-resources/types-of-consumer-fraud.html), while some experts suggest classification which first considers [group or individual targeting](https://longevity.stanford.edu/framework-for-a-taxonomy-of-fraud/).  Whatever our system, the limits of categorization quickly become apparent.  Some schemes target groups and individuals simultaneously.  Many scams borrow generously, their methods and mechanisms bleeding into one another, making them hard to pin down.  Categorizing fraud is an attempt to define the scope and range of all possible human behavior which uses deceit to exploit others for personal gain.  As a result, fraud’s internal boundaries can be unfocused.

While sometimes difficult, general categorization does help to provide clarity, specific instances of fraud are carefully examined and grouped based on their [*modus operandi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi).  Occasionally new groups are discovered and given names like [‘](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[Payroll Spoof](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[’](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[ or ‘](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[Ransomware](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[’](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm).  It is by dissecting specific species of fraud that new genera are discovered in the wild.

Using this approach, we can think of the Madoff investment scam as a specific species of fraud which belongs to the genus Ponzi Scheme.  The Ponzi genus belongs to the family of Investment Fraud, which also contains the genus Pyramid Scheme.  Members of the same family are distinct, but often share similar characteristics and mechanisms.  We could say that the Madoff and Amway schemes are related, as their genera are both members of the Investment Fraud family.

As Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, claim to be investments, yet have no underlying sources of revenue, many have viewed them with suspicion.  Some argue that Bitcoin is a Ponzi, while others counter that the comparison is erroneous as it shares traits with a pyramid scheme.   Surprisingly, despite intense scrutiny, Bitcoin has defied precise categorization as a specific form of investment fraud, leading some proponents to suggest that, as a result, it should be cleared of all charges, “*If it looks like a duck, but* *honks like a goose, then it can’t be either*”.

In actuality, categorizing the mother of all crypto as Ponzi or pyramid is an attempt to fit a square peg into a round hole.  Bitcoin is neither, it belongs to a new genus of fraud.  It has several specific qualities that make it unique, and many others that it shares with known forms of investment fraud, notably Ponzi and pyramid schemes.  By carefully examining Bitcoin’s construction and observing its relations with other forms of investment fraud, we can better understand the inner workings of the **Nakamoto scheme**.

# Odd Duck

Like a Ponzi, Bitcoin doesn’t specifically promote a need for liquidity or sales.  Like a pyramid, Bitcoin promotes, proselytizes, and preaches as realizing returns is dependent on new converts.

Like a Ponzi, Bitcoin doesn't sell the rights to acquire new members or sell products.  Like a pyramid, the right to sell something can be purchased, the ‘investment’ made during the mining process bestows Miners with the the right to sell the bitcoin they acquire.

Like a Ponzi, a Bitcoin investor’s returns don’t depend on their direct recruitment efforts.  Like a pyramid, a Bitcoin investors ability to realize returns depends on transactions with counter-parties recruited into the scheme.

Like a Ponzi, Bitcoin guarantees returns to investors.  Like a pyramid, Bitcoin investors entirely depend on recruitment to realize returns.

Bitcoin is a strange amalgam, and can best be described as an **extensible sub-fiat distributed virtual  investment fraud hybrid**, more easily referred to as a type of **Nakamoto Scheme**.

It is extensible because Bitcoin is a digital network and can be used as a scaffolding onto which other forms of investment fraud can be grafted (Ponzi, Pyramid, Pump and Dump).  It is sub-fiat, in that the initial investment in the scheme is not made with dollars, but with a commodity, as electricity is wasted during the mining process, giving the scheme a naturally occurring fiat on-ramp and valuation mechanism.  It is distributed, as the mining process creates a level playing field, a fair market, where a stake in the scheme can be purchased.  It is virtual, in that the scheme provides virtual returns which can only be realized via fraud which enables additional fiat on-ramps. It is an investment fraud hybrid, in that it shares many of the same characteristics and mechanisms that are found in related investment frauds.

We’ve known for some time that Bitcoin resembles other types of investment scams, so let’s take a look at what qualifies the Nakamoto scheme as a novel form of fraud.

&amp;#x200B;

[***FIGURE 1 - A Taxonomy of Fraud***](https://salbayat.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fraud-taxonomy2-1024x315.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Growing the flock**

Up until 2009, fraud could be conducted over digital networks, but Bitcoin is the world’s first case of investment fraud which is a digital network.  Because participants and software can interact with the network, new systems can be created which allow the extension of further schemes.

Centralized exchanges can be built which enable more traditional forms of financial schemes.  Exchanges can leverage insider information, or wash trade to manipulate prices, or they can front run clients to liquidate leveraged positions.  It is even possible conduct unregulated fractional reserve crypto-banking by selling synthetic bitcoin to customers.

Typically con-artists prefer to keep their schemes to themselves, but allowing others to build on top of Bitcoin helps to legitimize the scheme and attract liquidity from a wider audience.

**Taking Wing**

The most important, and most novel mechanism in the Nakamoto scheme is the way in which Proof-of-work (PoW) is leveraged and combined with mining rewards.  Originally, Hashcash’s PoW was proposed as a way to discourage e-mail spam or denial of service attacks by forcing senders to expend CPU time, and hence electricity.  Electricity costs money, and while the cost is small, it will scale with the number of emails sent, or connection attempts made.  This method of using PoW explicitly ties it to some type of **utility** being provided.  In contrast to the ethical ethos of hyper-financialization found in crypto, this method was preferred to [email micropayments as it avoided the administrative and moral issues related to charging for e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash).

In it’s original form, PoW expends electricity, but the **value** of that wasted electricity is a **cost** required to provide **utility.**  Because the goal of this system is to provide some good or service (**resource**), a price ceiling is established based on the subjective value of being able to send an email.

Nakamoto’s genius lay in realizing they could hijack proof-of-work to kill four birds with one bitcoin.

**Bird 1 – The Investment Vehicle**

Firstly, Nakamoto inverted Hashcash’s PoW.  Instead of being used to provide utility, the electricity expended by PoW could be tethered to the value of a digital token by a reward mechanism. In Nakamoto’s incarnation, participants have a chance to receive a reward in the form of bitcoin by conducting PoW calculations.  This process is referred to as mining, and it transforms the expenditure demanded by PoW from a cost into an ‘investment’ in the mind of the Miner.  To participants, the bitcoin they mine has intrinsic value equal to the amount of money spent to mine it (electricity + capital + other operating costs). This gives the token a concrete value for everyone who participates in the mining scheme, and creates the foundations for a market by providing a universal valuation mechanism.

As it does not concern itself with providing utility, Bitcoin’s only goal is value.  A price floor is created based on the amount of electricity used to generate a bitcoin.  To realize returns, Miners must exchange the tokens for a greater amount of value than the cost of electricity used to generate them. Instead of PoW being used to provide a good or service, what we might call a resource, it’s purpose is inverted to transform a cost into an investment.  To those who have been lured into mining, the ‘value’ of this investment is equal to the cost of electricity that they have used to generate the token.

Real economic exchanges involve the transfer of value for the utility of a resource, we give the baker money and in exchange receive our daily bread.  Real investments are expenditures, where we exchange value for something that will possibly return a greater amount of value to us in the future. With investments we are purchasing the utility of possible future returns.  Real Investments can be considered assets because they have mechanisms which can generate positive economic output, these mechanisms exist within a legal framework which defines them and enforces rules about their operation.  If you remove the legal framework and all mechanisms for generating positive economic output, then what you are left with is not an asset.  If value is exchanged in an economic transaction, but no good or service (resource) is returned, then no utility can be derived as there is no resource to consume.

&amp;#x200B;

All investment frauds attempt to change the nature of economic interactions from ones that trade value for the utility provided by resources, to ones that trade value for value.  Traditional schemes will seek to camouflage this subversion of utility and removal of revenue generation by hiding the fact that there are no underlying mechanisms that generate positive economic output.  We see this in the case of Ponzi and pyramid schemes.

For Bitcoin, external camouflage is unnecessary as its inversion of resources (provided utility) for value in proof-of-work means the system is premised on the exchange of value for value.  However, from the perspective of those participating in the scheme, Bitcoin is a logically consistent economic system as participants believe that the act of wasting electricity is a resource which provides utility, this resource is then exchanged for value by way of mining rewards.  Within the belief structure of the system Miners are like a business whose ‘investments’ fund the production of resources.  The protocol then exchanges value (bitcoin) to the Miners for the resource they produce.

Miners view what they produce as a resource which they exchange for value, however, because Bitcoin’s PoW is inverted, in the real world, Miners produce an externality, wasted electricity which amounts to an economic and environmental cost, just as it does in the Hashcash implementation.

In a Ponzi scheme, the more you invest, the greater your potential returns, investors are limited by the amount of money they have to contribute.  In a pyramid scheme, the more you work to recruit, the greater your potential returns, investors are limited by the amount of work they can do.  The Nakamoto scheme is unique in that its PoW implementation produces a blend of psychological elements from both schemes.  Potential returns are only limited by the amount of money Miners put to work, the scheme can appeal to their greed, as well as depend on a sense of entitlement to their returns as they have ‘worked’ for them.  The Nakamoto Scheme achieves the best of both worlds, it produces the psychological buy-in we see from pyramid schemes and creates a ponzi like investment structure that is less constrained as it benefits from indirect recruitment.

By creating an automated system that tethers a representation of value (bitcoin) to the value of electricity expended through PoW, the foundations of a fraudulent investment scheme are born.

**Bird 2 - Stake** **~~Ownership~~** **Distribution**

Secondly, Nakamoto combined bitcoin rewards with PoW to create a distributed scheme.  Running a distributed confidence game has many benefits but it also poses problems.  Sharing profits in the scheme helps to legitimize it and produce a network effect.  This greatly increases the reach of the scheme, which results in greater total liquidity invested into it, and as a consequence leads to greater returns extracted by co-operators.  Trust is an issue though, and the creator of the scheme needs a way to place themselves on even footing with potential co-operators.  Understandably, potential participants are less likely to trust in the scheme if up front demands for money are made.

Please note that I have settled on the usage of the word stake instead of ownership because, bizarrely, Bitcoin does not actually have a concept of ownership as we typically understand it.  Miners gain initial custodial ownership of a bitcoin, but the only right that is granted by this ‘ownership' is the right of sale.  All other rights typically afforded to owners are missing.

Instead of investing by giving money to a centralized authority, interested parties are asked to waste resources as a proxy for investment.  By requiring the consumption of a commodity to buy in on the ground floor and acquire stake in the scheme, Bitcoin is able to create a fair playing field as the PoW mechanism does not favour a particular participant.  This is an ‘honest’ way of determining stake in an open investment fraud.  As no central operator is taking the money invested, the stake acquisition process is more trustworthy and attractive to potential co-operators.

If I wanted to distribute stake in the analog world it would be much more difficult to provide a level playing field.  I could provide a way to certify that co-operators set fire to fiat currency, and then match their ‘investment’ by compensating them with an unforgeable coin equal in value to the amount of fiat burned.  However, this system has major drawbacks, as I could collude with investors to fake the fiat destruction, or some participants might attempt to use counterfeit currency.  Moreover, the process scales poorly, limiting the pool of potential participants.

When compared to an analog equivalent, Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work and coin rewards are an obviously superior method for creating an open distributed investment fraud, a key requirement for the  Nakamoto Scheme.

**Bird 3 - Guaranteed Returns**

Thirdly, Nakamoto needed a way to guarantee returns to investors.  The scheme had an investment vehicle, a way to value the investment, a mechanism to distribute stake, and a fair playing field that could serve as the foundation of a market, but it was missing a hook, the incentive that encourages participation.  In Bitcoin, it is the halving schedule for mining rewards which not only promises returns to investors, but actually delivers on them.

Bitcoin has a planned total money supply of 21,000,000 bitcoins and approximately 19 million are currently in circulation.  Nakamoto tied coin rewards to the PoW system whose supposed primary purpose is to select a Miner who can write data to a shared ledger.  The Bitcoin protocol adjusts its hashing difficulty so that a cryptographically hashed block of data can be written to the ledger every 10 minutes.  These blocks of data contain bitcoin transactions.

The Miner who guesses a hash that meets the difficulty requirements is able to write a block of data to the ledger.  All other work is discarded by Miners who failed to guess the correct hash.  As part of this process, the successful Miner includes an additional transaction where they are awarded a number of bitcoins.  This reward acts as an incentive for Miners to conduct the work necessary to maintain the Bitcoin system.  In 2009 Miners were rewarded with 50 bitcoin for writing a block to the ledger, however, every 210,000 blocks (around every 4 years) this reward halves, and in 2022, after 13 years, the current mining reward is 6.25 bitcoin.

Proof-of-work creates the investment vehicle, but it is the halving schedule which guarantees virtual investor returns.  A Miner who generates 50 bitcoin by using $50 of electricity will value their bitcoin at $1.  However, due to the halving schedule, in 4 years, to acquire another 50 bitcoins, the Miner will need to invest $100.  As they are fungible, any bitcoin mined before the halving date is mined at a discount.  After the halving date passes, the Miner must invest $2 per bitcoin in order to mine them.  The Miner has doubled their money in 4 years, equivalent to approximately 19% APY.

After halving a Miner must make twice the investment to earn the same rewards, the existing bitcoin have, effectively, doubled in value.  The Bitcoin protocol guarantees these returns.  Amazingly, within the context of the Bitcoin system, these returns are real, however, as a non-participant we would refer to these returns as virtual (and fraudulent), as they exist in the native digital token and not as fiat currency.

Moreover, because other Miners have started participating over those 4 years, the hash rate and hence difficulty of finding the correct hash has increased.  This means that overtime it has become more expensive to earn a bitcoin, meaning that it is possible that your investment has more than doubled after halving.  The halving doubles the value of a bitcoin at the time the halving occurs. Referencing our earlier example, if the Miner had invested $1 per bitcoin mined, but just before halving it took $4 of electricity to mine a bitcoin, post halving, the value of a bitcoin would be $8.  The Miner is up 8x on their initial investment.

It should be noted that the combination of PoW, bitcoin rewards, and the halving schedule produce information asymmetries that lead to arbitrage opportunities.  Some Miners may be more efficient in their production of bitcoin, leading to slightly different valuations.  Moreover, some Miners and speculators may be more savvy in regards to Bitcoin’s true nature and fundamental mechanisms, leading them to acquire bitcoin in anticipation of greater virtual returns.

These guaranteed returns offer an extremely strong incentive to participate in the system as early as possible. However, virtual returns come with a catch.  Investors can only realize the returns in fiat currency if they recruit others into the system.  This is effectively **a halfway point between a Ponzi and a pyramid scheme** and is a staggeringly brilliant innovation in deception.  **Virtual** returns that can only be realized if fiat liquidity is recruited into the fraud. The Nakamoto scheme is a masterpiece, and its creator a gifted idiot savant, or the Einstein of con artists.

**Bird 4 - Realizing Virtual Returns**

Fourthly, Nakamoto realized that PoW could be used to provide the **utility** of irreversible bitcoin ownership transfers, allowing participants to realize virtual returns either by trading bitcoin for goods and services, or for fiat currency. Bitcoin’s distributed append-only ledger allowed Miners to trade their bitcoin to one another, or to speculators, and no double spending meant a fair playing field to realize  returns through fraud.  This created a speculative marketplace where outside liquidity could be on-boarded into the scheme, the value of a mined bitcoin would not be constrained by the amount of electricity used to produce it.  This is the mechanism that enables the ponzi and pyramid like aspects that we are familiar with in Bitcoin and the reason why the scheme is dependent on disinformation, propaganda, and indoctrination, as recruitment is necessary to realize returns.

Have you ever wondered why Bitcoin makes such a poor payment network?  Why Nakamoto ignored or sidestepped questions on the transactional performance of Bitcoin and instead would focus on bandwidth?  What about the transactional profile of Bitcoin being far closer to something used to register real estate transactions, rather than a global payment network?  The answer is clear, transactions in Bitcoin are not meant to facilitate payments in the typical sense, they are useful insofar as they allow Miners and speculators to realize returns on their investments.

A speculative and deflationary ‘asset’ makes for a poor currency, people are disincentivized from using it today, as it might be worth considerably more tomorrow.  [This very criticism was leveled against Bitcoin on the BitcoinTalk forums in February 2010, as the design of coin rewards combined with the halving schedule rendered the protocol useless as a currency](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.0).  Few would spend something whose value appreciated 19% every year.  Nakamoto participated in this very forum thread and was well aware of the criticism, but shrewdly chose not to address the issue directly, ever careful to misdirect, lest too much attention be paid to Bitcoin’s fatal flaws.

By creating the narrative that these ownership transfers were entirely for payments, that Bitcoin was intended to be a form of electronic cash, Nakamoto was able to internally camouflage the true purpose of PoW and Bitcoin, the creation of a new form of investment fraud driven by speculation, and dependent on outside transfers of value in the form of fiat liquidity to realize virtual returns.

# Quoth the Raven

Bitcoin is not a form of electronic cash.  Bitcoin is not a store of value.  Bitcoin is not a hedge against inflation.  Nor is it digital gold, the future of finance, or an investment.  Bitcoin is a type of Nakamoto scheme, a form of investment fraud which leverages an unsound economic premise to enable transactions where no utility is exchanged.  The scheme is characterized by several unique properties:

* The tethering of a speculative digital token to a cost in order to create the illusion of an investment.
* The creation of a mechanism which can distribute stake in the scheme so that there are multiple co-operators instead of a single operator, i.e. a distributed open investment fraud.
* Virtual investment rewards are delivered to co-operators, these returns are not fraudulent to participants operating within the system’s context (to an outside observer they are fraudulent returns).
* As the scheme provides no underlying mechanisms to generate revenue, virtual returns can only be converted into real returns if participants become co-operators in subsequent investment frauds which enable the inflow of fiat liquidity.  A built in mechanism which allows the transfer of the digital token is used to convert virtual returns into goods and services or fiat currency.

These properties can be used to distinguish the scheme from more traditional forms of investment fraud like Ponzi and pyramid schemes.

**Proof-of-Stake**

Bitcoin inverts resources for value with proof-of-work to enable a new form of investment fraud; however, proof-of-stake (PoS) also enables value for value exchanges.  Although PoS systems are not sub-fiat and provide a less robust fair playing field to distribute stake, they are a more efficient, though less deceptive, form of Nakamoto scheme.  PoS allows a scheme to more effectively provide access to fiat liquidity, not only can we do away with an expensive stake distribution process, but there is no need to wait for the organic growth of subsequent investment schemes which provide exit liquidity for co-operators.

‘Investors’ provide seed money to an organization in exchange for tokens which guarantee virtual investment returns (fraudulent returns) by way of a staking mechanism.  This organization is then delegated with certain responsibilities.  It is tasked with creating promotional materials, such as a whitepaper, purchasing advertising, handling media relations, and creating some amount of demonstrable functionality.  Although the system will provide some form of functionality, due to the performance limitations of distributed append-only ledgers, this functionality will never be able to compete with existing in-market solutions, and hence there will never be a source of significant revenue which can compensate investors for their initial allocation of funds.  No resources, and hence no provided utility, are being exchanged for investor value.

The true purpose of this organization is not to create a product, but to promote their scheme to potential victims and work with existing scams like cryto exchanges, in order to provide exit liquidity for their investors.  As these centralized entities are doing a great deal of the heavy lifting to provide exit liquidity, we would expect that they would take a greater percentage of the profits and, as a result, we would expect to see more centralization in terms of token distribution (higher gini coefficient) in proof-of-stake systems vs. proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Proof-of-Stake crypto systems are a type of Nakamoto scheme as they fulfill all of our criteria, with slight modifications in that they provide a less robust but more efficient stake distribution mechanism, and centralize the development of subsequent investment frauds to enable inflows of fiat liquidity.

**Crash Landing**

The Nakamoto scheme is substantively different than a Ponzi or pyramid scheme and far more deceptive.  It leverages digital technology to create a form of economic disinformation which weaponizes investment fraud.  Tethering cost to a speculative digital token, which guarantees virtual returns but does not provide utility, is a fraudulent act that should be banned.  All systems which enable value for value transactions, where no underlying utility is provided in the exchange, drink from a poison chalice.

The most dangerous lies are the ones that we want to believe, and from alchemy to airdrops, the fantasy of getting something from nothing to get rich quick is commonly pressed into the service of exploitation.  This lie is so powerful that when a stranger holds it up to us as a promise of freedom, we are willingly deceived, careful to avoid peering too closely at what lay beyond the curtain of our own self-interest.  Instead we coat and varnish the ugly truth until it gleams, its dark heart hidden even from ourselves.  The cryptocurrency industry is rotten at its core; based on a carefully orchestrated deception, it cannot serve as the basis for rational economic exchanges.

Freedom is only possible where rights have space to exist, and for a technology that brands itself as the personification of liberty, Bitcoin is devoid of substance.  This absence does not stem from a lack of regulation, it is that Bitcoin does not contain anything that can be regulated.  There is nothing here and no room for freedoms, except the right to sell a bitcoin.  Hot air and hype cannot serve as the foundation for an economic system, and the creation of rules within the context of an investment fraud is madness.

Bitcoin uses a corrupted implementation of proof-of-work to recruit co-operators into an investment fraud and distribute its function.  It creates an investment vehicle in the form of a speculative digital token which guarantee returns.  The delivery of these virtual returns incentivize recruitment of fiat liquidity into the scheme, as the only way to realize profits is to find a greater fool.  These mechanisms align the self-interest of participants, and this alignment serves as a powerful force that ensures all co-operators act in concert to increase the value of a bitcoin by as much as is possible and extend the fraud to the furthest reaches of our civilization.

Using cryptographic hashing techniques to create an append only ledger is not in and of itself exploitative.  However, creating a mechanism that enables economic transactions where value is exchanged for value can only serve as a vehicle for fraud.  Bitcoin and all cryptocurrency systems as they exist in their present form are examples of harmful technology.  They are dangerous and should not be allowed to exist. Value must be tied to the utility provided by a resource, and not to deception or an externality.  By defining the unique characteristics of the Nakamoto scheme, we are better positioned to identify them so that we may act accordingly when they are encountered.

As it turns out, “*If it looks like a duck, but* *honks like a goose, then it’s probably related to both*”.

\-----------------------------------------------------

**NOTE:**  Nakamoto agrees with me on how Bitcoin is initially valued, as in the early years there was no 'market' to determine price. In the quote below, Nakamoto correctly predicts that subsequent inflows of fiat liquidity will affect how Bitcoin is priced, and hence how Miners choose to value what they produce.  Nakamoto understood the two phases of their scheme, the initial distribution of the scheme followed by ingestion of fiat through secondary fraud.

""*In the absence of a market to establish the price, NewLibertyStandard's  estimate based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service  (thanks).  The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the  production cost.  If the price is below cost, then production slows  down.  If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and  selling more.  At the same time, the increased production would increase  the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.*

\- The Dot Com Bubble peaked around March 2000. It bottomed out in Sep 2002. Any ideas why it took so long? Was it due to Septmber 11 or the 2001 recession? Any other significant factors I'm missing here. Did the enron situation have a major impact?

\- Another signal is the average time since the start of the downturn/market turbulence.

In the last major recession the peak was around June 2007 and it bottomed out around March 2009, around 21 months.

\- I'm also looking at the situation with the speculative assets in each of these major downturns, as they have been significantly depreciated near the bottoms (speculative tech stocks were down 90%-99% near the bottom of the dot com bubble, the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index was down 20% two years after the 2007 peak)

\- Currently Bitcoin, GME, and NFTs have still not fully depreciated to 90%+. Housing is still expensive, while the price probably won't decline like it did in 2007, I'd still expect a correction with the interest rates and layoffs.

In the first inversion and crash, we can see an outperformance by investing at the bottom of the market. However, it’s not near as much as you would expect from investing directly at the bottom. Five years after the crash the CAGR from the bottom is just under 2% higher than if we had just weathered the crash. By year twenty there is no discernable difference, in fact, ***buying at the bottom of the market underperformed!***

In this case, the 1988 inversion might be an outlier because in all of the other instances the margin of outperformance is larger.

[1998-2002 Inversion + Crash](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb34497b8-eed3-46b6-ae96-20f1db4ca9dc_1200x742.png)

I really wish there were more data points like this to analyze, but unfortunately, Portfolio Visualizer only goes back to 1985. However, I think we can still make some good observations given we have a 30+ year time window worth of information.

Still, across all of these charts, there is a noticeable trend that outperformance by buying at the bottom decreases over time. Under no circumstances did the gap actually increase. My intuition says that this is most likely because markets have a [mean-reverting nature](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/meanreversion.asp) when it comes to their return.

This can be demonstrated by some simple math, let’s say hypothetically that 90% of the time the market return is 10%. The other 10% of the time the market returns range from +30% to -30%.

If at the beginning of a 10-year period we experience a 30% decline in the market then statistically it is likely that the other nine years will have a 10% return.

We can take a look at this in an [investment calculator](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html?ctype=endamount&amp;ctargetamountv=1000000&amp;cstartingprinciplev=10000&amp;cyearsv=1&amp;cinterestratev=-30&amp;ccompound=annually&amp;ccontributeamountv=0&amp;cadditionat1=end&amp;ciadditionat1=monthly&amp;printit=0&amp;x=80&amp;y=15) and a [CAGR calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/cagr) to see that the returns and account value look as follows:

Year 1: $7000 CAGR: -30%

Year 2: $7700 CAGR: -12.25%

Year 3: $8470 CAGR: -5.38%

Year 4: $9317 CAGR: -1.75%

Year 5: $10,248.70 CAGR: 0.49%

Year 6: $11,273.57 CAGR: 2.02%

…

Year 10: $16505.63 CAGR: 5.14%

As you can see, over time the initial 30% dump matters much less on the overall return (even though from an account value standpoint, it could mean a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars, but even then, those hundreds of thousands make up a fraction of the entire account size).

This aforementioned phenomenon explains this graph:

[Difference between CAGR from Inversion and CAGR from the bottom of the market over time](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8aafb6df-a986-4d9f-aa59-4dcc0b74dae3_1200x742.png)

So pretty much, if we want to profit from a yield inversion, we would literally have to predict the exact bottom of the market. **AND** even if we did that, the historical performance shows that we still might end up behind.

But just as an experiment, let’s see how much of an edge we lose by being a couple of months off of the bottom of the market when we buy.

[CAGR based on the month](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfd85e7d-8bf2-4f15-8d5b-353e589471d1_1200x742.png)[ invested in the 1998-2002 crash](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfd85e7d-8bf2-4f15-8d5b-353e589471d1_1200x742.png)

If you are able to get within 10 months of the market bottom, (either before or after) the worst you can do is **beat the market by 1% annually.** This holds up even out to the twenty-year threshold. Which according to our investment calculator, amounts to about a 19% bigger nest egg.

But…

This is not as generous as it seems. Say you make a compromise between the median and mean number of months from the inversion to the market bottom (about 25 months).

You wait for an inversion and then pull all your money out of the market. You do this for 25 months regardless of the current market climate before reinvesting…

Only four out of the seven times in the last forty years would you have been within the range. That’s barely better than a coin toss!

Let me explain, all 5 banks in Canada all perform well all things considered, would it really matter then if you bought one bank like RBC instead of all 5 and incur more headaches in terms of balancing things out between the banks, plus more trading fees? This assumes we don't want to buy an ETF and instead would like to mimic the ETF holdings without having to pay the management fees...

Apply the same idea with REITs, when banking sector does well real estate does well, so REITS go up with banks.

Alternatively, if real estate does poorly, banks do poorly as well, so banks go down along with REITS.

Would there be a point then in terms of diversifying, to buy into both sectors if the risk profile is the same?

As many know, ETFs are claimed to be superior by all counts compared to individual stock picking. For a dividend growth investor like myself, I did a little more digging to see if this is true.

I took the some of the top holdings from a dividend ETF called ZDV that tracks the top dividend aristocrats in Canada, and the distribution growth rate is no where near the dividend growth rate of the underlying securities!

Here's a bit of the calculations to show you what I mean:

[https://dividendchannel.com/symbol/zdv.ca/](https://dividendchannel.com/symbol/zdv.ca/)

As you can see, the ETF does not really increase it's distributions, when I averaged it out on a yearly basis, it came around to 1. something per cent in growth which doesn't even keep up with inflation.

Comparatively, if you were to hold the underlying holdings, you would be way better off:

RBC has a yearly increase from the past 5 years of 6.3% which is one of the funds biggest holdings.

Enbridge, another large holding increases by almost 10% a year!

Do this with all of the holdings and you'll see that they are increasing *far more* than what the fund does...

The same idea applies with their US dividend fund...

So my question is, can anyone give me a reasonable explanation as to why this is the case?

Thanks.

But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.

""The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.

t3_vf8rix|1655566695|investing|selling ETF now to buy at lower price : is there a catch ?|"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen in recent days more posts about people questioning their DCA habit (should I pause it ? should I put more? should I put less?). The usual answers on r/bogleheads (and perhaps even here?) are either ""*time in the market beats timing the market*"" , ""*you can't time the market so just don't think/ask*"" and/or ""*if you're so sure it's going down even more : why don't you just short the market ?*"".

&amp;#x200B;

My concern with such answers is they don't provide any **factual proof** that during a 1)**clear** 2)**long** bear market (it's even a crash), changing the **way** we DCA is not better than just acting like a robot and waiting 3 or 5 years to break even. In short my concern is about **optimization during crashes** like this current one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To be practical, let's take my case :

\- I've DCAed (monthly) about 70k€ in VWCE ETF (**724 shares / average price : 98.75€**)

\- it's currently at \~90€ (**-9%** for me)

\- my current (potential) loss : \~-6000€

&amp;#x200B;

If it goes at -20% I would be losing 10k€ , if -30% : 18k€ etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have 2 options :

\- A)keep **DCAing monthly** and it it gets very low I would have to wait years to get back to 0%,

or

\- B)**sell now**, losing 6000€  and using those 65k€ to buy VWCE back when it will be at 74€ (**-30%** from its january's highest : nothing absurd or crazily pessimistic) : 884 shares. Hence a 21k-6k=\~**16k€ gain**. Plus a shortened time at a potential loss position.

&amp;#x200B;

When I asked about this on other subreddits, people were unanimously against B), saying I can't time the market successfully (*saying this crisis is clearly at least as bad at the previous recent ones and hence the market can't stop at a -20% decrease is now called ""timing the market""?!*) and, perhaps more strange, that A) is good enough &amp; the time I will lose on the way up isn't important ""on the long run""...

&amp;#x200B;

So : **what am I not seeing that seems so obvious to everyone ?** One part of me thinks, indeed, ""*if it was so easy why everyone isn't selling now to do the same in 1 or 3 months?*"" but I can't find practical (read mathematical) arguments against it ...

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT : wow! It's amazing how many people commented so fast, and gave extremely well argued answers. Based on the comments, I now get where my confusion came from : thinking what is ""easy"" on paper can be implemented as easily (ignoring my psychology). Also, from some comments, it seems I don't consider ""timing the market"" what most people consider it to be :)

So, I will keep DCAing , perhaps just adjusting the amount and/or frequency a little for some psychological coherence.

My contention is that this time is truly different.  Hear me out.

During 2001-2003, while the overall equity markets were down each of the three years, there was still money to be made in commodities, fixed income, and precious metals.

In 2008, which is the worst market of all our lifetimes, one could make money in alternatives, fixed income (especially taxable income), and healthcare.

Even in 1973-74, there was money to be made in T-Bills, T-Bonds, and real estate.

This year has been different. There is money to be made in commodities especially with energy.  The only other sector that has been profitable is agriculture.  What seems to make this different, is that the more traditional hedges against down markets such as fixed income and precious metals have been losers too. The last time we had a market that was down over -20% and the treasury bond index was negative was in 1931. It appears we are in new territory for many of us, including professionals. This is function of rising interest rates from historical lows and an uncertain future for the global economy.  Based on inflationary numbers, every country on this planet is feeling it.

t3_ve9t80|1655460795|investing|Investors on Reddit have a clear US bias. Here is why you should consider other countries too|"US total market cap as % of GDP is much higher compared to the rest of the world. This number is currently at 150% compared to 120% for Japan, 100% UK and only around 60% for Eurozone. The gap has narrowed over the last few months (US was at 200%), but remains well above historical averages. USD also appreciated by 20% against most other currencies during this period making other markets cheaper.

Now there are good reasons why these markets have a lower valuation. Namely slower growth and demographics. But at the same time I think it more than compensates by being cheaper. 

Consider the Eurozone which is almost 3x cheaper. Structural issues, high debt, Russia conflict. But the countries are working on structural improvements and integration. With the UK gone it will be much easier. Japan has the demographics issue and high debt too. However, yen is currently at a 24 year low, there is no inflation and a massive structural opportunity for higher labour participation and foreign investment. These are areas that the government is working on.

Let's go a bit further and consider some emerging markets. My two favourites are Poland and Indonesia. 

Poland is roughly the size of Spain in terms of population and size, and has a third of its debt. It has one of the best growth prospects in the EU. Excellent geographic location close to the centre. A bridge between east and west. Will massively benefit from the coming integration of Ukraine. However, the total market cap of all public companies there is $180bn. That is roughly the market cap of Adobe. Spain in comparison has a market cap of $800bn.

Indonesia has a market cap of around $400bn which is the size of Nvidia and smaller than Tesla. This is a country with a population almost the same size as the US. Has a huge young working age population that will continue to grow over the next decade fuelling consumption. The country is growing at 5-6% a year. It is arguably becoming one of the next large, low-cost manufacturing centres with many companies abandoning China.

I don't know what China/India did before the Russian/Ukranian invasion. A blend of various nations I'm sure, just like any other country. The narrative being passed around is currently ""they purchased less oil from Russia than compared to now"". 

If all we did (the US + ""morally upstanding countries"") was (partially) move our supplier from Russia to Saudis (or whoever could fill the gap in demand), and all China + India did was move their supplier from Saudis to Russia (giving Saudis more supply to sell it us), where is the actual shift in the overall supply/demand that is driving gas to be elevated?

Let's assume demand is/has been relatively constant (if anything it's declining because people are driving less now that it's high but that's irrelevant in my opinion).

Let's assume zero countries can magically flip a switch and come up with more supply (they don't want to for profitability reasons/they literally can't do it on a dime).

I'm well aware that nobody would want to invest short term (1-5 years) in oil because the current macroeconomic picture is a world that at least attempts to move away from fossil fuels in the name of climate change concerns/a hope for an Earth with less global ""pollution"" / ""greenhouse gases"".

t3_vdp537|1655394860|investing|Robinhood (HOOD) is Below its Intrinsic Value, and it is likely to Rise when High-Risk Retail Leave their Platform|"**Prelude**: Robinhood is a financial brokerage that is customarily abused by retail traders and degenerates to trade stocks and options, mostly options. Even though Robinhood gained plenty of ground in early 2021 and was trading at about $70 a share, it has now cratered to about 10% of its peak price. Currently, on June 16th, 2022, Robinhood is trading at about $6.80 a share. Robinhood is fundamentally undervalued, even though it may have a bit more to fall.

**Assets VS Liabilities, Intrinsic Value:** On December 31, 2022, Robinhood had $19.77 Billion in assets, and it also had $12.5 Billion in liabilities. What's even better is that most of these assets are liquid, cash, and account receivables. If all assets were subtracted by their liabilities, they would be worth about $8.42 a share. That's a raw undervaluation of about 25%.

**Robinhood is Losing its Users but Only Their Bad Ones:** Robinhood in last quarter's earnings call lost about 10% of its users year over year due to market panic. (15.9 million monthly users VS 17.7 million) I figure that these users were mostly dead weight. If you think about Robinhood's business structure, you would figure out that they sell user information to hedge funds in order to manipulate the market, I mean track retail performance. These are low-quality users, the ones that are leaving, stay on their platform for a temporary period of time, and they are at high risk as they trade options. These low-quality users seem to dilute Robinhood's aggregate worth to hedge funds. The users that stay on the platform after the market crash are likely to be more conservative, and they are likely to stay longer, which means Robinhood will have a more consistent revenue stream that is also worth more per user. This can be proven through the increase in their Assets Under Custody, which increased to $93.1 Billion from $80.9 Billion the previous year. They have also seen a 30% increase in net deposits, which supports my theory.

**Robinhood is Already Attempting to Implement Casual Financials to a Conservative Crowd, and in Other Words, are Trying to Appeal to Low-Risk Retail:** In Robinhood's 2022 roadmap, it states that it:

* Wants to Focus on Long-Term Investing
* Acquired Ziglu Limited to Spread to the European Financial and Coin Markets
* Attempts to dish out retirement accounts
* Launched Their Robinhood Debit Card

What does this mean? It means that, as I said earlier, Robinhood is trying to appeal to a more stable crowd when it comes to its service. Robinhood is trying to stay relevant to the users that previously traded high-risk securities on its platform. They also acquired Ziglu Limited in order to spread to the European market, I believe this may come with higher profits.

**Potential Profitability and Competitive Advantages:** Since Robinhood is trying to appeal to a more stable and financially savvy crowd, they will likely make more money for Robinhood. They will both spend more on stable securities and will be at lower risk of default, combined with their European expansion, they will have a better userbase that will stay longer. And as much as people seem to deny it, Robinhood is a commission-free brokerage. They have the reputation of ""democratizing finance""; which is going to sit well with more conservative retail investors, and if they manage to pull a 180 and turn over their reputation, they will see a massive influx.

**Risks:**

* **Turnaround Failure:** If this turnaround fails, which it seems is not the case, then Robinhood may be forced to shut down business for good. Since Robinhood still has positive assets to liabilities, it will be a net positive in liquidation.
* **Retail Fear:** If the retail traders get scared off by the market crash, they might stop using the service, bankrupting them as they need large volumes to function efficiently."|0.41|0|0|0|['Ziglu Limited', 'Intrinsic Value:*', 'the European Financial and Coin Markets', 'Robinhood']

Hi everyone. I would love a few eyes on this to get your thoughts on what you would consider best for my current situation. I'm going to be moving away from my current house (Property B) and am faced with selling it our renting it out. (This is South Florida- Palm Beach County) I'll give what I think is the relevant data and will be extremely grateful for those willing to offer their wisdom. Thanks so much for your time.

**Property A is a 3/1 SFH.** (Rented out. Great tenant.)

Current mortgage (PITI) is $1000. Rental income is $2200. After maintenance and income tax (which I estimate at $500 a month) my net is +$700.

Further: Currently owe $115,000 with 24 years left on an 5/1 ARM loan (still have 4 years left on loan before interest rate changes) that currently has a 3.09% rate. Could sale for $400,000 (a conservative estimate). Obviously, selling it would net me $285,000 (hardly any capital gains taxes since I lived in it 2 of the past 5 years).

**Property B is a 3/2 SFH with 2 offices**. (I am about to move out of this within a couple of months).

Current mortgage (PITI) is $1850. I spend $100 per month on maintenance. Rent would be $3300 per month if I decided to rent it out.

Further: I currently owe $275,000 with a 3.25% ***fixed*** rate. My realtor thinks that this could sell for $600,000. And I've lived her the past 2 years, so hardly any capital gains tax here either, giving me flexibility if I decide to sell one or the other.

Currently I'm leaning towards holding both as investments and renting them both out. Property management costs would be $0 per month as I would still be close enough to take care of everything.

The prospect of faster-than-expected monetary tightening has rattled Wall Street, dragging the S&amp;P 500 deeper into bear territory Tuesday and forcing investors to reassess ***a stock market that doesn’t look cheap even after its dramatic selloff.***

It has been an ugly spell in markets, reflecting concerns about how the economy will hold up as the Federal Reserve embarks on its sharpest campaign of interest-rate increases in decades. Investors expect an increase of 0.75 percentage point on Wednesday, which would be the largest since 1994. 

Many investors contend that the worst in markets might soon be over, given the extended declines in many market sectors this year and the generally healthy state of the U.S. economy. They say buying the dip has fallen out of favor during this year’s rout but that negative sentiment is often a precursor to an extended rebound.

But ***even many optimists in the stock market concede that a rebound would have to contend with some significant obstacles, first and foremost the continued high level of valuations, which over time tend to be one of the strongest factors for predicting market performance.*** Even with the S&amp;P 500 down 22% in 2022, many investors and analysts fear that stock-market valuations have further to fall. The S&amp;P 500 traded Monday at 15.8 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, according to FactSet, still above the 15-year average of 15.7.

Raising rates Wednesday by a larger 0.75-percentage-point, or 75-basis-point, jump could be one way for the Fed to catch up to an increase in inflation that has been far higher and persistent than officials anticipated. Evidence that measures of inflation expectations by businesses and households over the long run are rising would be especially alarming inside the central bank.

“My sense is that the Fed has decided to do 75 basis points rather than 50 basis points because of the data we’ve gotten over the last week or so showing higher inflation and maybe some more disturbing news on inflation expectations,” former New York Fed President William Dudley said at The Wall Street Journal CFO Network event on Tuesday.

But he said he expected officials were “probably splitting the difference” by opting instead for the 0.75-percentage-point move.

Analysts who closely parse the central bank’s policies were divided Tuesday over whether the potential costs outweighed any benefits from shifting to a more aggressive 0.75-percentage-point rate rise from the half-point rate increase expected before the recent inflation reports.

Some warned that the central bank, by having recently provided unusually precise steers that it would raise rates by a half percentage point this week, risked sowing greater confusion in financial markets. Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, in a note to clients on Tuesday said he was worried that the 0.75-point rate increase “is not embedded in a credible and systematic policy strategy and, without this, risks looking like a panicky response…that may not age well.”

Mr. Guha, a former adviser at the New York Fed, said such a move created a “serious morning-after problem” by inviting difficult-to-answer questions about what the Fed would do next. 

***The Fed’s campaign to tame inflation is upending the dynamics that ruled the stock market in recent years, when rock-bottom interest rates drove investors to seek returns in risky assets. The popular view that there were no alternatives to stocks helped push the S&amp;P 500 ever higher, reaching a recent valuation peak in September 2020 of 24.1 times its projected earnings.***

More recently, ***worries about inflation and the path of interest-rate increases have provoked turmoil in markets as well as vigorous debate over the right valuations for stocks in the current environment.*** One source of concern is the risk that the Fed’s tightening will push the economy into a recession, damaging both business fundamentals and investor sentiment. More immediately, higher interest rates reduce the value of companies’ future cash flows in frequently used pricing models.

One concern for financial markets is that bond investors are beginning to anticipate not only a sharper path of increases, but a higher destination or so-called terminal rate for the Fed. On Tuesday, investors in interest-rate futures markets placed a nearly 89% probability that the Fed would lift rates to around 4% or higher by June 2023. That market-implied probability was at 1% four weeks ago, according to CME Group.

In periods of distress, investors can be quick to decide that stocks are worth much less. And historically, valuations have fallen farther before bottoming. In the selloff of December 2018, during the Fed’s most recent previous rate-raising cycle, the S&amp;P 500’s forward multiple fell as low as 13.8. In the depths of the March 2020 selloff, as the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic shut down swaths of the economy, the index traded as low as 13.4 times its projected earnings. 

***“Markets don’t typically bottom near historical medians,” said Greg Swenson, portfolio manager at Leuthold Group. “They tend to overshoot on the downside from a valuation perspective.”***

Adding to concerns for stock investors: ***Many have begun to worry that corporate profits are coming under threat, suggesting that valuation measures based on earnings projections could be understating how expensive stocks really are.*** U.S. companies have warned of challenges on multiple fronts, from rising costs to a foreign-exchange hit from a stronger dollar.

***“Those valuation multiples are based on a really overly optimistic earnings outlook,” Mr. Swenson said.***

***Another valuation model, the Buffett Indicator, compares the value of publicly traded companies in the U.S. with the country’s gross national product. As of the end of last week, a version of that measure was 29% above its historical average and above its peak in the dot-com bubble days of 2000***, suggesting that the market is overvalued. The metric was named for Warren Buffett, who once called the indicator “probably the best single measure of where [stock market] valuations stand at any given moment.” 

Two recent surveys have shown signs that consumers’ long-term inflation expectations are rising. Fed officials have said they would want to respond aggressively to signs that such expectations were rising, or becoming “de-anchored,” because they believe the process of wringing inflation from the economy will become far more difficult if that has happened.

A couple notes:

1) ***For investors utilizing the passive strategy, none of this matters.***  The original plan was to DCA through thick and thin into the index, and none of this news alters that plan, at all.  Financial news like this is targeted towards people with an active component to their investment strategy.

2) One key theme in this article is that ***valuations matter***.  This time is no different. 
 Most bears over several years have been warning about this, but there has been no catalyst to spook the market until lately, that catalyst being persistent inflation.

3) ***Don't Fight the Fed***.  This should be self-evident by now to newer investors.

edit

4) An extra note.  One of the bolded quotes in the article:

&gt;Many have begun to worry that corporate profits are coming under threat, suggesting that valuation measures based on earnings projections could be understating how expensive stocks really are.

This is why CAPE is valuable.  CAPE does not go off earnings projections...it instead goes off historical earnings.

t3_vcrbmr|1655288572|investing|A concept to earn an extra return on your investment from people who liquidate their investment prematurely|" 

Hi all,

So I thought of this concept where you get together as a kind of investment club and individually choose the investment size of an agreed upon investment (eg. S&amp;P500 Index) and individually choose an investment period. When you set these parameters, you may also determine a so called ""commitment rate"", which is a percentage of your investments size (anything between 0%-100%). The size of your ""commitment rate"" results in the ""commitment deposit""(investment size x commitment rate) and determines two things: 1. Your deposit to the commitment pool and 2. Your claim to the commitment pool (Your commitment deposit / Total commitment pool deposits).

Now, should someone else in this investment club prematurely withdraw his investment within his own set investment period, his commitment pool deposit will remain in the commitment pool and be distributed to the other investment club members according to their commitment pool claim.

If you stick to your investment period your commitment pool will be returned in full, including the gain of the asset itself during the investment period, plus commitment pool deposits of those who withdrew prematurely.

Bottom line, if you hold to your assets (which what we are clearly advised to do by oh so many people) you will be extra rewarded who panic or speculate and withdraw their funds.

What are your constructive thoughts?"|1.0|1|0|1|[]

* The meeting is set to take place at 11 a.m. Frankfurt time

*Carolynn Look*

&gt; The European Central Bank’s Governing Council will hold an unscheduled meeting to discuss the recent selloff in government bonds, which has grown in intensity after plans were announced to begin raising interest rates from record lows.
&gt; 
&gt; The rate-setting panel will convene on Wednesday “to discuss current market conditions,” according to an ECB spokesperson. The meeting will begin at 11am Frankfurt time, a person familiar with the matter said. A statement may follow.
&gt; 
&gt; The announcement comes after the yield on Italy’s 10-year debt rose above 4% for the first time since 2014 this week. Investors are so far unconvinced the ECB can raise borrowing costs to combat unprecedented euro-zone inflation while also keeping yields among the bloc’s most vulnerable members in check.
&gt; 
&gt; A possible 75 basis-point rate increase from the Federal Reserve later in the day could add to the jitters.
&gt; 
&gt; Italian yields fell back as much as 29 basis points to 3.89% at Wednesday’s open, while the euro rose as much as 0.6% to 1.0475 against the dollar and money markets pared bets on a half-point rate hike next month to 50%.
&gt; 
&gt; “The central bank needs to be concerned if investors cannot buy or sell bonds in secondary markets and issuers have to postpone funding,” said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank. “In contrast to earlier episodes of disorderly market movements, however, inflation makes the difference this time around. The ECB cannot simply pour money at the problem as monetary tightening and higher rates are actually needed.”
&gt; 
&gt; While government bonds have been jumpy for some time, the ECB has so far only allocated reinvestments from its pandemic asset-purchase program toward stabilizing what it considers unwarranted market turbulence.
&gt; 
&gt; Investors, meanwhile, have been on the lookout for an additional instrument to tackle so-called fragmentation, and there was some disappointment when officials didn’t unveil one at their policy meeting last week.
&gt; 
&gt; ### ‘No Limits’
&gt; 
&gt; While the Governing Council says it can quickly devise a new tool, it’s been reluctant to reveal details, convinced that there are few benefits in doing so and worried the markets may immediately try to test its limits.
&gt; 
&gt; Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel -- who’s in charge of the ECB’s market operations -- signaled Tuesday evening that any response to bond-market panic will come when it’s needed and will depend on the specific situation officials are faced with.
&gt; 
&gt; She did, however, pledge that the ECB won’t tolerate “changes in financing conditions that go beyond fundamental factors and that threaten monetary-policy transmission,” saying the commitment to stave off fragmentation “has no limits.”
&gt; 
&gt; Those remarks drew parallels to former ECB President Mario Draghi’s famous 2012 promise to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. Schnabel highlighted the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and the OMT created under Draghi as examples of policy makers’ ability to respond to different kinds of market stress.
&gt; 
&gt; The bond storm comes with the ECB poised to end eight years of negative rates with a “sustained” cycle of hikes planned from July and including a likely half-point move in September. It plans to end net purchases under a long-standing bond-buying program at the start of next month.
&gt; 
&gt; Several Governing Council members were due to speak on Wednesday. Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel’s remarks at 11:15 a.m. in Milan have been cancelled, as have Bank of Spain chief Pablo Hernandez de Cos’s at 2:30 p.m.
&gt; 
&gt; Wednesday’s ad hoc meeting was first reported by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

Because of this I wanted to give the below example portfolio portraying how to use a LETF because I agree with the majority that going 100% into a LETF is not typically a good idea. 

Anyways, consider someone who is currently 100% S&amp;P but would like to increase their exposure to 120%. To do this they could allocate 90% to the S&amp;P and the other 10% to UPRO (3x S&amp;P ETF). Initially when the trades are made, this person will have 120% exposure. However, as the market moves this exposure will move as well. When the market is down, their exposure will fall as UPRO will fall 3x more than the S&amp;P and vice versa on the upside. What this shows is that although UPRO’s leverage is reset daily, the portfolio leverage is not; the portfolio’s leverage will adjust with the market. This portfolio can then be rebalanced back to target based on a calendar rebalancing or a rebalancing range. 

Thus, assuming UPRO can continue to earn 3x daily returns as it has in the past, this is a decent way to increase exposure while limiting some of the downsides of LETFs. One must keep in mind though that over the long term the return will likely be less than 1.2x the S&amp;P due to UPRO’s fees.

Since 2009 when UPRO was created, this portfolio has earned 15.2% annually compared to the S&amp;P’s 13.25. This comes out to about 1.147x the S&amp;P. Since 1993, this portfolio has earned 10.93% compared to the S&amp;P’s 9.97%. This comes out to 1.096x the S&amp;P. As you can see, you won’t consistently get 1.2x exposure over the LT but if your goal is to increase exposure a bit this is definitely a possibility with LETFs."|0.89|28|0|28|['LETFs', 'UPRO']

***[Sorry, typo. Backwardation is spot &gt; future. Although this was clarified in the following sentence, the above typo may have confused some people.]***

Physical commodities have a cost of carry that include risk premium, accounting costs, storage. For commodities like oil, this cost of carry adds a certain dollar amount to the cost of a barrel. WTI Crude today trades at a 10+% discount six months out from now. The discount 12 months out is nearly 20%. 

* **Breakeven Inflation**

Markets are pricing in an average inflation much lower than 3% over the following ten years. This is not much further off from rates we were seeing in late 2021. The average 10y breakeven for Q4 2021 was 2.53% vs 2.74% today. 

* **US Dollar Index**

Most world currencies are tanking, resulting in strong US Dollar performance. Paradigms can shift, so this may become old knowledge, but the past decade has shown that a strong US Dollar results in dollar scarcity and deflationary tendencies. Could a more compartmentalized global economy change this? It is possible although fully theoretical.

Nick Timiraos

&gt; A string of [troubling inflation reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-economy-federal-reserve-11655134682?mod=article_inline) in recent days is likely to lead Federal Reserve officials to consider surprising markets with a larger-than-expected 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase at their meeting this week.
&gt; 
&gt; Before officials began their premeeting quiet period on June 4, they had signaled they were prepared to raise interest rates by a half percentage point this week and again at their meeting in July. But they also had said their outlook depended on the economy evolving as they expected. [Last week’s inflation report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-may-2022-11654810079?mod=article_inline) from the Labor Department showed a bigger jump in prices in May than officials had anticipated.
&gt; 
&gt; Two consumer surveys have also shown households’ expectations of future inflation have increased in recent days. That data could alarm Fed officials because they believe such expectations can be self-fulfilling.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point at [its meeting last month](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-approves-half-point-interest-rate-rise-ratcheting-up-its-inflation-fight-11651687201?mod=article_inline), the first such increase since 2000, to a range between 0.75% and 1%. The Fed last raised rates by 0.75 percentage point at a meeting in 1994, when the central bank was rapidly raising rates to pre-empt a potential rise in inflation.
&gt; 
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has avoided surprising markets on the day of policy meetings, instead arguing that the central bank can achieve its goals of tightening policy by shaping market expectations.
&gt; 
&gt; But he also said in an interview last month that the Fed would be guided by the economic data to come. “What we need to see is clear and convincing evidence that inflation pressures are abating and inflation is coming down. And if we don’t see that, then we’ll have to consider moving more aggressively,” Mr. Powell said.
&gt; 
&gt; At [a news conference](https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-fed-chief-powells-postmeeting-press-conference-11651696613?mod=article_inline) last month, Mr. Powell said the central bank would “strive to avoid adding uncertainty” but also acknowledged the possibility of “further surprises” in the inflation data. “We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The Labor Department reported Friday that its consumer-price index rose 8.6% in May from the same month a year earlier, pushing inflation to a 40-year high. That was a setback for forecasters who were looking for signs that inflation had peaked in March. Rising fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions from Russia’s war against Ukraine have sent prices up in recent months.
&gt; 
&gt; A handful of Wall Street forecasters, including at investment banks Barclays and Jefferies, said Friday, after the inflation data were released, that they expected the Fed to raise rates by 0.75 percentage point this week.
&gt; 
&gt; “We believe that risk-management considerations call for aggressive action to reinforce the Fed’s inflation-fighting credibility,” Barclays economists wrote in a subsequent report Monday. While such a move “would go against communications leading into the blackout period,” the report said “risks of prolonged inflation have intensified,” justifying the larger rate rise.
&gt; 
&gt; After the publication of this article on Monday afternoon, other forecasters, including at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said they expected a 0.75-percentage-point rate rise this week.
&gt; 
&gt; On Friday, a University of Michigan survey of consumers’ long-term inflation expectations rose to its highest level since 2008. On Monday, the New York Fed reported that its survey showed consumers’ short-term inflation expectations had jumped and that the distribution of households’ longer-term expectations was more varied than in the past, suggesting more households might be expecting higher inflation to stay, even though the median didn’t rise.
&gt; 
&gt; Fed officials have said they would want to respond aggressively to signs that inflation expectations were rising, or becoming “de-anchored,” because they believe the process of wringing inflation from the economy will become far more difficult if that has happened.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s a one-two punch,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They’ve got to go now with 75. The Fed is behind the curve, and they know it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Bond yields, which surged Friday amid a broad market selloff, continued to climb as [that rout deepened on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-fears-send-u-s-bond-yields-surging-ahead-of-fed-meeting-11655135691?mod=article_inline). Investors in interest-rate futures markets placed a nearly 30% probability on the larger 0.75-percentage-point increase on Monday afternoon, up from around 4% before last Friday’s inflation reports, according to CME Group. After publication of this article, those market-implied probabilities rose above 90%.
&gt; Consumers’ inflation expectations for both the short and long term are on the upswing, according to surveys.
&gt; 
&gt; Officials will have to weigh several considerations at their two-day meeting that begins on Tuesday. They could stick with their current strategy of raising rates in half-percentage-point increments indefinitely until they see signs that inflation is conclusively downshifting.
&gt; 
&gt; Such a path of rate rises would lift the Fed’s overnight benchmark rate to a range between 2.25% and 2.5% by September, and to a range between 3.25% and 3.5% by December. This would represent the most aggressive interval of policy tightening since the 1980s.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, Mr. Powell and his colleagues could signal a rising likelihood of shifting to larger rate rises at the Fed’s meeting in late July.
&gt; 
&gt; But if officials anticipate a significant likelihood of such an increase at the July 26-27 meeting, they could decide to move more aggressively this week.
&gt; 
&gt; Ms. Swonk said she expected officials to make such an argument at this week’s meeting. “The data now is not good. The data is saying they have to do more,” said Ms. Swonk. “We’re moving into a more inflation-prone world, and they know that, and if they don’t derail it now, this could be incredibly corrosive.”
&gt; 
&gt; Already, borrowing costs set by markets have climbed faster than the Fed’s benchmark rate in anticipation of its policy moves. Mortgage lenders on Monday said they were beginning to quote a 30-year fixed loan with rates above 6%, levels that haven’t been reached since 2008.
&gt; 
&gt; Other analysts said Monday afternoon that a larger 0.75-point rate jump would cause more problems for the central bank than it would solve by confusing investors about how the Fed reacts to new data.
&gt; 
&gt; “It just opens up additional communication challenges thereafter,” said Neil Dutta, an economist at research firm Renaissance Macro. “It suggests the Fed is losing confidence in its forecast. We all know they were trying to catch up, but now it looks like they are panicking.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Dutta said he also worried that a supersize rate increase would make it harder for the central bank to avoid a recession. “It suggests the Fed is willing to push the economy into a ‘hard-landing’-like scenario to get inflation under control,” he said.

The more often you look at your portfolio, the more likely you are to make a mistake. 

So I’m thinking once a year for re-balancing?

Mind you, ideally you want the re-balancing to be as tax-efficient as possible…

Also, when do you decide to increase and decrease exposure of an asset class? Seems like it’s market timing more than anything tbh…

Take gold for instance, do you increase exposure from 5 to 10% before high inflation? How do you know though it’s coming (before it happened I’m talking about I know it’s here lol)?

Further, when do you know that it’s time to cut back on that asset allocation? When inflation goes back down obviously, but you only know that *after* the fact and by that point gold price would already be factored in…

I think it is a safe bet to say that in the next year the wheat and corn ETFs $CORN and $WEAT will perform very well. Estimates are saying that up to 30% of the world's grain could be missing and I don't see how this won't be the case. Even if the war ended today, they still would not have enough time to grow and export. What is the bear case for these commodities? Edit - I think it is also safe to say that this is not priced into the market yet since (even a conservative estimate ) 20% of the world's grain and corn will be out of the market.

t3_vbndxc|1655156843|investing|Opinion: Growth stocks make just as much sense as Value stocks right now|"Firstly, when I refer to Growth vs Value, let’s assume I mean the holdings of VUG vs those of VTV. 

Anyway, after spending a couple of hours per day for the last couple of months reading up on the macro economic environment and trying to gauge where things are heading, I have come to the conclusion… It a futile exercise. It’s a very complex system with no underlying unifying logic, and nobody knows a whole lot about where anything is heading right now. 

Regardless, let’s go with the general consensus for arguments sake, that there will be a recession that sets stocks back around another 20% or so which would be 40% or so down from the ATH. 

From my point of view, the fundamentals don’t currently look great for either growth or value stocks. Considering the state of play, there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020, but it is. Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. 

Based on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. 

I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&amp;P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&amp;P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. 

Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. 

Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. 

My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. 

On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount.

The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now.  It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. 

TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks.

This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this."|0.82|74|0|74|['VTV', 'Home Depot', 'VOO', 'Microsoft', 'Meta', 'Amazon', 'Visa', 'VUG']

According to this, housing acted as an inflation hedge during the great stagflation era of the 70's:

Basically that would mean yield is extremely low, and your returns mostly came from price appreciation.

Compare that the stock market at the same time whereby:

1. You basically broke even more or less when adjusting for inflation
2. Your returns if any come from yield, or dividends, rather than share appreciation

Edit: Thanks for all your feedback. Trust me my job is really stable in the public sector and even if I did get fired on the spot, which I’ve never seen, I would still get a minimum of one week back pay and cash out all my annual leave I have saved up.

I decided to keep my savings account untouched and cut the minimum amount I keep in my checking account by $2,000. The $2,000 will be in my brokerage account and I will invest it in one lump sum into index funds if the market REALLY dips. I will continue my same dollar cost averaging into index funds every month I’ll just have $2,000 less in my checking account and $2,000 in cash in my brokerage account(unless I invest that). 

Once the market recovers/stabilizes I’ll increase the minimum amount in my checking account by 2,000 and if I did not invest the 2,000 in my brokerage account I’ll transfer it back to my checking.

Note that it is in today’s prices (e.g. adjusted for inflation). Before even looking at the 1970’s, look at the 50’s and 60’s. Each decade brought new incremental lows to the price of oil, and society was designed around the premise of cheap oil, from travel to manufacturing to home heating. Little effort was made on efficiency, because for almost 3 decades oil got progressively cheaper each year. Like a Thanksgiving turkey, the American economy loved the farmer that fed it from December to November.

Now we come to stagflation. Oil went from $28 a barrel in December 1973 to  $63 in January of 1974 - just a month later. The historical high price of oil was $32 in 1948. To put this in modern terms, it would be like oil hitting $300 a barrel by mid-July from $120 now. This energy shock is what caused the twin pillagers of economic stagnation (they laid me off!) and inflation (it costs me how much to fill up my tank?). The problem was not bad monetary policy in 1973. I mean, it might have been bad, but  it didn’t matter much at all compared to the overnight explosion of prices in the necessary commodity that underpinned the global economy, from food to airplanes. I really must emphasize the food point, without tractors and gas we can’t feed 98% of the world with only 2% working the fields. Minus fossil fuels, that ratio flips - you need 98% of the population farming to feed the lucky 2% who can have a different job. That’s what made the medieval era different. 

Why did oil skyrocket like that? [Because America’s support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war of 1973 led to the OPEC oil embargo](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/oil-shock-of-1973-74). As we are learning now, if an oil cartel decides to pick a side in a war, they can take a pound of flesh. Though Russia is only a fraction as dominant now as OPEC was then. 

I’ve seen folks debating whether Volker’s deflationary and merciless interest rate hikes helped lower demand enough. I’ve seen folks suggest Reagan’s inflationary and optimistic tax cuts somehow voodooed the economic back into shape. Both are efforts to paint the target on top of the bullet holes already in the wall. Oil peaked in May of 1980 and dropped off a cliff in January 1986*. The reason for that collapse? [Saudi Arabia wanted to take more market share and increased production](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1986/06/1986b_bpea_gately_adelman_griffin.pdf). The lesson of stagflation isn’t some cautionary tale about monetary policy. It’s about the price of energy, full stop. Preventing Volker or Reagan had anything to do with it more than on the margins is just an exercise in comfort - it’s nice to think that we can choose leaders who might fix something. In reality they are all riding the same elephant, and they aren’t the ones telling it what to do. Some, however, do a better job of convincing others that they are in charge. 

The one thing we could (and did) meaningfully do that was in our control was reduce waste - double pane windows to keep heat inside in winter, smarter manufacturing processes, more fuel efficient cares, etc. The decline in price from 1980 to 1986 was the product of getting smarter about energy use. Saudi Arabia just saw the writing on the wall and decided to grab market share while it could. It was in their interest to encourage uncritical oil consumption long term. 

Any news article or comment you see that brings up the dreaded specter of stagflation had better provide a reason for why we change-point jump into a new energy pricing regime, because that’s what it takes. Be as pessimistic or optimistic as you’re intuition allows about what’s coming, but it’s important to know the history of stagflation given how much it’s coming up. And that history is basically: you are in less control than you think you are. 

Now, with all that in mind, scroll down to the [third graph on this page](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth). This (long term, not short term) is the most important thing happening right now, just like the OPEC embargo was the most important thing happening during stagflation. The cheaper energy is, the less we have to think about it, and the more we can think about computers, social networks, graphics cards, AI, EVs, etc. The fun economy starts after the “eat your vegetables” economy of energy price ends.

Before anyone replies to this by saying “hahahah silly that would never happen, we have insurance now!” bank insurance is not full coverage.

I’m looking for a discussion more so about the economic side of things, like is it even *economically* possible?

Let me explain what I mean, in Lebanon for instance where I have relatives from, the banks imposed capital controls.

The reason for which was because everyone for whatever reason started pulling out their US dollars in cash from the bank.

The banks, operating on fractional reserve, did not have enough US dollars to meet the demand from depositors asking for their money back.

In order to prevent a run, they have imposed a bank freeze so you can’t pull any money out in order to prevent a run on banks. It’s been like that for years to this day.

Now, in *ordinary* circumstances, the central bank can simply step in and inject in theory as much liquidity as needed. However, because other countries like Lebanon don’t have the power to print US dollars like the US does, they’re stuck.

So, *here lies my question*, in the *worst case scenario* is it even possible economically speaking for there to be a bank freeze?

Initially I thought no, but then I realized there’s only so much money they can keep printing to meet depositors demand before inflation racks up.

Better yet, take for instance the present, we already *have* high inflation, so wouldn’t that mean central bank is limited in how much it can print now.

Say people start pulling out their money now, banks get a bail out, people soon after pull out again when inflation remains high and central bank refuses a bail.

Is there ever a scenario where there’s a bank freeze?

If so, how would that work? How would the economy function? Barter?

Stagflation = high unemployment + high inflation

If we do nothing, then inflation gets worse as it’s self re-enforcing, and unemployment gets higher as people consume less due to rising inflation and that means companies make less money leading to more layoffs…

Let me expand, say we hike inflation cools, then there's another recession prompting a cut in rates into negative territory. Yes I know other countries have done this, but I'm talking a little more, like bottom bottom bottom of the negative pit to the point where any further and banks would lose money lending out at that rate so it's in real terms the bottom.

Say in that case they gradually start hiking up but after first hike, there's another huge multi-factor catalyst causing another recession and the central bank wants to lower again.

*However,* because it's so low in negative territory already, they simply cannot go lower; well they could go back down to before that one hike they did, so assume they want back down one bump, *then what*.

Let me summarize my question:

**What happens when the central bank has gone into negative interest rates so low - some countries are negative already, but there's a tiny bit more space I've ready in theory they could go down so this is a scenario where they're essentially there - but it's not enough to act as a cushion that prevents said recession.

t3_vae7mh|1655007988|investing|An article posted yesterday on the MBS market|"Michael Burry posted a link to this article in a tweet but I think it's worth reposting here (it's worth noting he didn't write the article but merely linked to it in his tweet)


&gt; During the last forty-four years, my days have begun and ended with the mortgage market. Four painful moments stand out. Today makes five. (There have been many more good days, but even the Fairy Godmother has her limits.)
&gt; 
&gt; Mortgages are covered poorly in financial press, as stocks and such are much more entertaining. Today’s events still unfolding will take days for good coverage. Freddie’s weekly survey will not discover today until next Thursday. But the MBS market is real-time, not like old, sleepy S&amp;L days.
&gt; 
&gt; The CPI news this morning was so awful that it changed the bond market’s view of Fed trajectory, and the weakest sector broke. In bond jargon, MBS went “no-bid.” No buyers for MBS. Then a few posted prices beyond borrower demand, not wanting to buy except at penalty prices. Overnight the retail consequence has been a leap from roughly 5.50% to 6.00% for low-fee 30-fixed loans.
&gt; 
&gt; The physics of collisions... the second one does the harm. When your car hits a telephone pole, no problem. Then, after a slight lag, trouble comes when you hit the inside of your car. Same thing in football: helmet on helmet is all-okay... until your brain hits the inside of your skull.
&gt; The same physics govern housing collisions with mortgages. At the new year mortgages were still three-ish. In February, four. At the end of March, five. May, five-and-a-half. Historically, a two-percentage-point rise from cyclical trough has iced housing, the freeze underway a month ago. Now up by three points, and _double_ January.
&gt; 
&gt; The pause in housing between the first collision and second is elongated because of human nature. Someone desperate to buy a house is still desperate, and modestly relieved to buy even at a higher price and rate so long as not forced into an unlimited auction. Now it’s time for Wile E. Coyote in his Acme sneakers, running off into thin air and all okay until he looks down.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking down... MBS are such a weird market that other markets have not processed what is happening. Stocks are down 2% today, but would be down a hell of a lot more if considering what a full-stop to housing will mean.
&gt; 
&gt; Another marker of MBS distress: the 10-year T-note had held 3.00% since April, the important top in 2012 and 2018. Trading 3.05% yesterday, now 3.20% -- retail mortgages jumped *triple* that amount. The 10s/mortgages spread today is almost 300bps and double the 10s’ yield. Inconceivable. The Fed telltale 2-year T-note had held 2.70% since April, 2.85% yesterday, today 3.05% adding only one more .25% hike to the 2-cast, which is not enough to explain MBS overnight.
&gt; 
&gt; **Today’s CPI Trigger.** Markets were braced for a bad report, but not this. Overall CPI jumped 1.0% in May. Any thought of deceleration... ka-blooie. CPI 8.6% in the last year, accelerating under pressure from Ukraine energy dislocation.
&gt; 
&gt; Many observers this morning say that the CPI news is so lousy that there is no point in looking at the details. Wrong. From the onset of Covid to Ukraine, our inflation problem was supply chain, mostly manufactured goods. Since Ukraine, it has shifted to energy.
&gt; 
&gt; Different elements of CPI have different weightings, which conceal the effect of energy in a crisis like this. In May the energy index within CPI... up 34.6% in May alone. In an event like this, the notion of excluding the high-volatility “core” is meaningless.   
&gt; *Everything* requires energy. The uppers and soles of your Nikes are fossil fuel. Food has its own Ukraine issue, but energy is the problem, from fuel to fertilizer.
&gt; 
&gt; Oil was $75/bbl pre-Ukraine, then held just above $100, now $120. Natural gas from normal $4-$5/mbtu... since Ukraine $9. The May increase in fuel oil, $16.9%. May utility natural gas, up 8% in the month. You can see component-by-component, month-by-month CPI here [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) Table A.
&gt; 
&gt; **Those Other Four Moments...**
&gt; 
&gt; 1. 1979, Saturday of Columbus Day Weekend, Paul Volcker announced that the Fed would allow the cost of money to float as high as necessary. Mortgages 11% on Friday, on Tuesday after the holiday 13%. However! That was 15 years into entrenched inflation, oil ten times as expensive in 1979 as 1972, and our economy just beginning energy conservation and new supply. All incomes ramped right along with inflation. The US economy was a “things” economy, with little overseas competition for union-heavy US labor.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. 1994, February... the cost of money coming out of recession 1.00%, by year-end 1994 to 5.25% -- but in a disinflationary world, the cost of money was one-half the cycle peak four years before. 1994, February to May, mortgages from 7% to 9% -- that magic two-point rise flattened housing, and the Fed had to cut in 1995 to dodge recession. The new mortgage peak, stabilizing near 8% was down from 11% in 1990, and we enjoyed a genuine and rare soft landing.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. 2007, July... you had to be deep in the mortgage racket to understand the first collision. Subprime and Jumbos went no-bid, and stayed there. The Fed was slow to understand the credit panic, began frantic cuts the following winter from 5.25% to 2.00%. But mortgages did not respond, stuck above 6.00%.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. 2008, July... the no-bid expanded to all mortgages, even government guaranteed. The 10-year T-note anticipating recession and worse fell to 3.50% while retail mortgages rose to 7.00%. That 350bps spread is the closest comparable to today’s 300bps.
&gt; 
&gt; **Now What.** At Thanksgiving 2008 the credit markets (all markets) were rescued by Ben Bernanke’s genius, announcing quantitative easing -- buying enough MBS and Treasurys to unlock markets in which all had been afraid to buy.
&gt; 
&gt; Today... is it a coincidence that MBS have blown simultaneously with the Fed’s flip from QE buying to allowing runoff and threatening to sell? The weak break first. MBS are weird, and weird under stress is weak.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed has had a plan, Powell becoming more concise each day: We will raise the cost of money until inflation comes under control. “It is our job to calibrate demand to supply.” A good, tidy, sorta mathematic way to proceed. But destruction of demand has limits, and this morning we hit one.
&gt; 
&gt; In today’s US, nobody is prepared to deal with inflation as it has developed in the last 90 days. Inflation can drop and even stabilize above the Fed’s target, but the world is only three months into finding alternate energy for Europe’s oil and gas imports from Russia. Including natural gas, something like 15% of the world’s energy supply has been dislocated.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps half will quickly be redirected. India and China are buying at a deep discount from Vladimir, which makes available much of the supply which those two used to buy elsewhere, Europe lining up. But Russian production is already suffering, a net and permanent loss. Alternate supplies require alternate delivery, gas especially tough -- absent pipelines, all gas deliveries are dependent on scarce LNG ships and terminals. Coal normal, $50-$100/ton... today $395.
&gt; 
&gt; In this circumstance, the Fed’s demand destruction has all the wisdom of Xi’s zero-covid. In a rational world, if the party in power in DC were not encumbered by climateers, we would turn on the hose, take every step to unimpede production and delivery. Instead of threatening to tax windfall profits, we would offer incentive price guarantees to protect producers from the energy price drop certain to lie ahead. This is an energy problem, not some amorphous inflation amoeba.
&gt; 
&gt; Below the 10-year T-note in the last twenty years. In 2018 there were a few days with trades above 3.20%, so in theory 10s have not broken that critical support. Theories like that tend to last a few days. The Fed has to decide how much destruction it has in mind.

Now, they are yielding above 9%.  Both [Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/janet-yellens-half-hearted-apology-wont-save-the-us-economy/) have admitted that they got inflation wrong by calling it transitory.  Bottom line, looks like high rates on I Bonds are here to stay for a while.

Given that formerly conventional fixed income strategies like laddered CDs and government bond funds are still yielding extremely sub par amounts, this creates an opening for I Bonds, excepting the $10k limit, to be a go-to instrument for a myriad number of circumstances:

* Inflation protection 
* Saving for a down payment on a house
* Fixed income securities for those in retirement
* Playing the spread, i.e. getting XYZ debt for, say, 5% and putting the proceeds into I Bonds yielding over 9% (the logic is the same as incurring low rate debt to put in the market)
* Other short term investments
* Safe Haven for active investment strategies
* etc etc

The limiting factor is the $10k annual limit.  People have been coming up with methods to circumvent this limit, the logic (not the method) being similar to coming up with methods to circumvent the limits for Roth IRAs.  The latter is considered legal and legitimate.  Shouldn't the former also be considered so as well?  If so, shouldn't it be exploited for the incredible results such strategies would yield compared to currently available options?

Two methods I've seen so far:

[Revocable Living Trusts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ulcvj9/setting_up_revocable_living_trusts_for_the/)

[Limited Liability Corporations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v75mv0/can_you_avoid_ibond_limits_with_llcs/)

For those reading the financial news, there have been a lot of comparisons made between markets today and that of the 70s, when inflation was high and returns in the stock market were negative for over a decade.  If other fixed income instruments continue to provide not only zero protection but rather a vulnerability to prolonged inflation, I Bonds become part of an optimal strategy for wealth preservation.

The main downside for I Bonds is that they provide zero real return, and after taxes may actually result in negative real returns.  However, compared to the myriad options in the market today yielding extreme negative real returns (like HYSAs yielding -8% real returns), I Bonds still look great.

Do you agree that I Bonds sans the $10k limit are an optimal investment vehicle for many situations?  Do you agree that exploring options to circumvent the limit are valid?  If so, what other methods do you know can circumvent the $10k limit?

---

edit -  Looking over the comments, it's clear that a lot of people do not understand the term ""real return"" or what it has to do with inflation and I Bonds.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realrateofreturn.asp

1) I bonds track inflation.  I bonds yield 9.62%.  This is a nominal rate of return.

2) Inflation per the CPI calculation I bonds use is 9.62%.

3) 9.62 - 9.62 = 0% real return.

4) Your nominal interest, i.e. 9.62%, is taxed at the federal level.

5) 0% real return - your taxes on interest = negative real return.

A lot of people posting here do not understand that while 9.62% looks great, it is a nominal return.  Accounting for inflation, it provides a zero real return, and after taxes, you actually get a negative real return with I bonds.  Still better than most other investments out there, but it pays to know that you're still losing with this investment, and that in the long run it is not a viable replacement for investments designed to provide a real rate of return over time.

Screaming at the top of your lungs that you don't understand the above is not conducive to a sound investment strategy."|0.66|12|0|12|['Fed', '-8', 'Treasury', 'Revocable Living Trusts](https://www.reddit.com', 'Safe Haven']

## Business / Developments

Crocs main business is related to it’s famous clogs, while it tries to expand it’s brand in the sandals market. Additionally it makes money from the personalization options via Jibbitz, which according to the company achieves higher engagement and buying frequency for the products family as a whole supported by strong licenses like Disney brands.

**Growth**

To increase growth Crocs focuses on:

* increasing digital sales
* expanding in the sandals market
* growth in Asia

**Growth in Asia**

2/3 of all store openings were made in Asia with most of them in China. Over a quarter of all stores are based in Korea which is suprising at first and indicates a strong presence of the brand. Still most revenue growth was achieved in the Americas and EMEA, which doesn’t fit the companies aim to drive growth with Asia.

## HEYDUDE Acquisition

In it’s most recent quarterly report Crocs explained the acquisition of the HEYDUDE shoe brand on Febuary 17 2022. With a purchase price of $2.3 billion and additional expenses, it is Crocs first relevant acquisition and has been financed with $450 million in stock and over $2 billion in borrowings. The borrowing compromises mostly of an entry in the Term Loan B Facility with an interest rate equal to the SOFR plus additional 3.5% resulting in around 4% at the moment. With $115 million in revenue and $16 million this **quarter** the acquisition has a P/S of over 5 and a P/E of 39, which doesn’t really make it a bargain. Crocs stated it sees potential for HEYDUDE to reach 1 billion dollars in sales by 2024, which was the main reason for it’s purchase. With HEYDUDE already achieving high profits in it’s growth phase, large increases in it’s revenue would have a large impact on Crocs bottom line. We still have to take those estimates with a grain of salt, as almost no information is available. They state a guidance for around $800 million dollars for this year alone, which we will use in one of our DCF models.

## Financials

## Revenue Generation

||2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Americas|640,515|863,613|1,607,012|
|Asia Pacific|348,072|278,515 |350,160|
|EMEA|241,948|243,660|356,157|

Table 1: Segment Revenues

Even though Crocs tries to focus it’s expansion efforts on Asia, the large part of it’s existing revenue

and growth came from the Americas (mostly USA).

||2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|1,036,273|1,023,513|1,088,205|1,230,593 |1,385,951|2,313,416|

|Operating Profit Margin|Loss|Loss|5,8%|10,5%|15,4%|29,5%|

Table 2: Sales and Profitablility

Looking at this table it almost speaks for itself. Crocs has increased it’s prices by 25% and has experienced a suprising large increase in units sold. It’s operating margin has developed from a loss to almost 30%. Most of it can be attributed to a recent hype for Crocs shoes with lots of attention coming from the hypebeast community. We will search for more answers on the development of the operating margin, by looking at the cost structure.

## Cost Structure (before HEYDUDE acquisition)

||2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cost of sales|51,7%|49,5%|48,5%|49,9%|45,9%|38,6%|
|SGA|48,6%|48,3%|45,5%|39,7%|37,1%|31,9%|
|Operating Margin|\-0,6%|1,7%|5,8%|10,5%|15,4%|29,5%|

Table 3: Costs as a percentage of revenue

Over the years Crocs SGA expenses have hovered around the $500 million mark, while it decreased relative to revenues, when revenues finally picked up pace in 2019. The cost of sales always trailed revenue, but as the average price per unit increased by 12% from 2019-2020 the realtive cost of sales decreased by 8%. Similar developments occured, when Crocs raised it’s average price per unit by another 12% the cost of sales portion shrunk by another 15%. This development and it’s significant increase in pure unit sales allowed Crocs to develop from barely profitable into a cash-cow.

## Industry Comparison

|Company|Operating Margin|Cost of sales|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nike|15%|55%|
|Deckers|20%|46%|
|Sketchers|9,5%|51%|
|Adidas|9,4%|49,3%|

Their unique product gives Crocs a competitive advantage, which has finally shown in 2020 and 2021. They top most big player in the footwear business in terms of operating margin as they were able to raise their prices significantly, which the highly competitive “normal” manufacturers weren’t able to do.

## Balance Sheet

With the Acquisition of HEYDUDE, Crocs balance sheet has doubled in size.

The most relevant changes of the last quarter included:

* Assets
   * Addition of $640 million in Goodwill
   * Addition of $1,88 billion in Intangibles
   * Doubling in inventory size ($213 million → $407 million), which isn’t concerning as most of the increase was due to the acquisition
* Liabilities
   * Addition of $2 billion in Long-term borrowings
   * Addition of $329 million in Long-term deferred tax liabilities

## Treasury Stock

Crocs has bought back 47,7 million shares which lie in the books at a value of around $1,7 billion dollars, which gives them an average cost basis of around $35 per share. This gives them very nice protection against a hostile takeover and the ability to raise good amounts of cash if needed.

## Debt Level

At a debt level of $2,8 billion Crocs interest expense amounts for $20 million per quarter. Looking at their Income, it’s safe to say that it won’t have much trouble with it’s debt. The management also announced in the investor presentation that one of it’s financial efforts will be a quick deleveraging.

## Cashflow Statement

## Share based compensation

Share based compensation has amounted for $8,2 million dollar or around 10% of net income in the first quarter. On an annual basis this amounts for around 1% of the total market cap at the price. This isn’t alarming in my opinion.

## CapEx and Depreciation&amp;Amortization

|As a percentage of revenue|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|D&amp;A|3,3%|3,2%|2,7%|2,0%|2,0%|1,4%|
|CapEx|1,2%|1,3%|2,0%|3,0%|3,0%|2,4%|

CapEx hovered between 1-3% of revenue, which is good news for a manufacturing company. They increased their CapEx fivefold, which indicated new investments to meet higher demand for their products. The HEYDUDE acquisition won’t increase amortization as most of the purchased intangible assets consist of trademarks and workforce, which can’t be tax deducted.

## Share Buybacks

Share buybacks have been excessive in the past year, even though they have been made at a high price per share of $120 which is not appealing at all, but was due too the sky high prices of up to $180 in November. In the future further share repurchases are paused until the deleveraging has reached it’s target, which as stated in the report won’t happen in 2022.

## Other

## Insider Trading / Ownership

Since the share price dropped under $90 there has been some small and big purchases by the upper management. During the skyrocketing, there have been significant sales as the price began to climb above $50. We will keep that in mind for later.

## Analyst coverage / Institutional Ownership

There are 11 analysts (5) covering the stock (for comparision Amazon: 38), which is quite high and a negative. The institutional ownership is also high with 80% (4). Not a sign that a company is under the radar.

## Risks

* Decreasing hype for their product
* Flop of HEYDUDE acquisition
* Price decreases destroying their operating margin
* No real market evaluation possible as Crocs is a unique product → no certainty the market will grow
* Competitiors meeting their quality standards, thus stealing market share
* Not gaining a foothold in China
* Not gaining a foothold in the sandal industry

## DCF

Summary of the Assumptions made:

* By the managements guidance from investor presentation (3)
   * $750-$800 million dollars in revenue for HEYDUDE in 2022
   * Operating margin of 26%+ long term for Crocs (2026Estimate) and 26%+ for HEYDUDE in 2024E
   * Crocs revenue growth of 17% / HEYDUDE 20%+
   * CapEx: 3% of revenue
* Our assumptions
   * SGA Expenses and cost of sales have increases sharply. We will still take the resulting 18% operating margin at face value for our base case (15% bear case, 20% best case)

Inflation accelerated further in May, with prices rising 8.6% from a  year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981, the Bureau of  Labor Statistics reported Friday.

The consumer price index, a  wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more  than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding volatile food and energy  prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9%  estimate.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared to respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.

Surging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.

Energy  prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to  34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain,  pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.

Shelter costs, which account  for about a one-third weighting on the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month,  the fastest one-month gain since March 2004. The 5.5% 12-month gain is  the most since February 1991.

Finally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.

Those  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month.  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though  average hourly earnings rose 0.3%. On a 12-month basis, real average  hourly earnings were down 3%.

Markets reacted negatively to the  report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall  Street and government bond yields rising.

Some of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%).

Friday’s numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.

The  inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a  rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May’s report  likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest  rate increases ahead.

“Obviously, nothing is good in this report,”  said Julian Bridgen, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic  research firm. “There is nothing in there that’s going to give the Fed  any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.”

With  75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets  widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and  possibly into 2023. The central bank’s benchmark short-term borrowing  rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to  2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.

Inflation has been a political headache for the White House and President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).

Administration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to [the Covid pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/), imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services, and [the Russian attack on Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).

In  a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further  improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the  budget deficit.

However, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering  inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that  the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.

How  much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper  with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go  further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current  inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears  because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now."|0.98|2590|0|2590|['CME Group', 'Wall Street Journal', 'Fed', 'the Federal Reserve', 'Treasury', 'the White House', 'the Bureau of  Labor Statistics', 'Dow Jones']

t3_v9113e|1654841239|investing|Opening up Pandora’s box of ETF distributions|"Hi guys,

So I went down a little rabbit hole in terms of ETF distributions to see what truly lies behind the red curtain of these gizmos. I made a couple findings that I found to be quite striking and had a few questions about them, and would love to know your thoughts.

1. What’s the true essence of ROC, are there limits to it, and if so what are they?

Take for instance these two funds, ZDV and ZDI. 

https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/advisors/zdv-bmo-canadian-dividend-etf/

https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/advisors/zdi-bmo-international-dividend-etf/

One is a Canadian dividend fund and the other is an international dividend fund, same product maker though which is BMO.

If you look at distribution history for both, ZDV - Canadian one - has been flat in terms of distributions (since 2020).

On the other hand, ZDI has seen big cuts in terms of total distributions in the same time frame.

In the case of ZDV, distribution from dividends were cut, either due to the funds re-balancing *or* underlying securities cut *or* a combo of both.

*However* the total distribution was left unaffected due to ROC masking the cut in dividends.

On the other hand, distribution from dividends actually *increased* for the other fund, although total distributions actually *decreased*! This was because the fund cut ROC.

This left me confused and hence raises the question, why? The entire point of ROC if understood is to have some stability in monthly distributions. Instead of weird numbers like 5234 one month and 6,700 next and 6k next month after that, ROC comes in as a buffer of sorts to smoothen out distributions. So why in the world would they decide to cut it? 

This leads me to believe that there’s limits to ROC and how much can be used. If true, I’m curious to know - in seeking to assess funds in the future - what that limit is…

2. How does a fund asses capital gains distributions?

This is in regard to covered call ETFs, premiums are considered to be capital gains. Yet, take a fund like ZWC, and strangely enough there’s zero distributions coming from capital gains!

https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/advisors/zwc-bmo-canadian-high-dividend-covered-call-etf/

Surely it’s not because they didn’t sell any calls, that defeats the purpose of the fund. So why are there no capital gains? 

The only other source of distribution here - other than dividends - is ROC. 

This leads me to believe that ROC is not only “your cash coming back to you”. It has more powers than we give it credit for.

My theory is that for whatever reason, the fund has decided that the capital gains for whatever reason have become ROC. Is this possible? If so, why would they do this? Also, wouldn’t this break the idea that ROC is just your money back to you? It can also be capital gains too - hidden capital gains in a way.

3. Dividend cuts from covered calls do not make sense?

Compare ZDV the Canadian dividend fund linked above, and ZWC it’s covered call counterpart:

https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/advisors/zwc-bmo-canadian-high-dividend-covered-call-etf/

From 2020 to 2021, distributions *specifically* from dividends for both funds got cut by around 20%. 

I don’t get how this is possible. When you buy a covered call ETF, you have the added risk of getting called away for your securities meaning your distributions from dividends would get cut. This is *in addition* to the risks of cutting from things like re-adjusting the portfolio, or underlying securities cutting dividends, or both. 

Wouldn’t this mean then that both of the covered call ETF would have much more of a cut than the other one all else being equal?

You might say who cares? Well this all leads to my theory about ROC. This is the only other variable that seems to explain all of these strange things happening to distributions. Either that or I’m just completely missing something…

In any event, would love to know what you guys think about all of this!

Thanks in advance.

Leaving distributions aside, the global dividend aristocrat ETF has been flat more or less for 10 years.

My question is, what would the share appreciation look like on a covered call version of said index?

One the one hand, part of me thinks if the non-covered call version is flat, the share appreciation on the covered call version would be negative.

On the other hand, the other part of me thinks it would also be identically flat?

If I have a basket of securities and sell covered calls on them but don’t re-invest premiums or dividends and instead keep it as cash, the share appreciation would look identical to a strategy in which one didn’t use a covered call strategy no?

Thanks.

t3_v8uqwl|1654819773|investing|Why do people say covered calls are “safer” than normal dividend ETFs for retirement?|"Hi guys,

Why do they say this? They claim it’s safer in the sense that the distributions are not as volatile. 

Is this true?

Dividend aristocrats have a track record of increasing for 25 years. 

We don’t really have a track record of gradual consistent increases in premiums from selling calls for 25 years now do we?

What happens if markets collapse hard and fast? People have said that the covered calls would outperform, but is this really true?

If the markets entered a depression, people would be less willing to give you a high premium for a call as the market is so put friendly at that point.

The fund will thus have a slash in premiums from covered calls meaning your distributions get slashed too!

Even on the upside, say we have an extreme crypto like run up, the fund managers may have to cut back on selling calls in order to prevent so many securities from getting called.

Distributions would thus get slashed in this case too!


Unless ROC would mask these extreme events, and all three of these components would work in tandem flawlessly more so than a normal dividend etf would which only has ROC and dividends. Not sure tbh…

What do you guys think?

Thanks.

t3_v8u9ue|1654818345|investing|Questions re ROC in the event of an ETF dividend cut?|"Hi guys,

I was wondering, say you decide to invest in a US dividend aristocrat ETF and then we enter a depression of sorts whereby the aristocrats cut by 30%.

Usually, some well designed funds will have some ROC every month comprise the ETFs distributions to make the monthly income look stable. So instead of 5k one month 2k another 6k the next, it’s 5k all year long and anything left/increase is given on the last month of the year.

Here’s my question though, are there limits to ROC in the event of a massive dividend cut by the funds underlying securities? 

Like say XYZ fund wants to maintain a consistent dividend increase and doesn’t want distributions to get cut by 30% which will spook the ETF holders. They instead decide to mask the 30% cut with ROC, until markets recover and they slowly pull back the ROC as the dividends increase again.

My question is, are there limits to how far they can mask with ROC, if so how do we know what that limit is?

I assume the ROC comes from the cash reserve of the fund? Like when you buy into it, part of the cash you gave the ETF is kept on reserve as cash for purposes like ROC right? Can the fund simply sell underlying securities to increase cash position and increase ROC? (I’m not talking about adjusting for allocation, I’m saying selling out to increase cash reserves) I don’t think so as that would be capital gains or loss, unless ROC can be these things as well?

t3_v7su29|1654703623|investing|This Time It’s Different – 4 most dangerous words in Investment world|"https://www.tflguide.com/this-time-its-different/

Sir John Templeton, the investing pioneer had famously said, ‘This time it’s different’ statement is very dangerous. It is very apt for investors – if you often start hearing ‘This time it’s different’ you should start getting worried.

Why do people say ‘This time it’s different’ ?? Because there’s no other way to prove that they are right. This time it’s different can have many interpretations in the markets –

4 most dangerous words in Investment world

1) Making the same mistakes again 

Investors tend to make the same mistakes again or make the mistakes other investors made earlier. They do not learn from mistakes. When markets are rising, they feel that “it will be different this time” and do not remember the crash earlier.

For example, in the year 2000, the dot-com bubble and some market manipulation led to the indices zooming upwards. Retail investors bought stocks at high prices. Then the Sensex lost 2000 points in 3 months leading to big losses for retail investors. They did not evaluate the market well. They went along with the herd to buy stocks without understanding the fundamentals.

In 2007, FIIs invested a huge amount in India, this led to a rise in the stock markets – valuation ran much ahead of the fundamentals. Investors again made the mistake of buying at high prices with the reasoning that “this time is different” as there are no dot-com movements and big institutions are investing. Media started publishing articles India needs Infrastructure &amp; real estate blah blah so ‘This time it’s different’. In 2008, the stock market crashed and investors lost again.

No body was ready to invest in 2008 end because they thought ‘This time it’s different’ – the world is going to end.

Investors feel that this time it is different and they will not make the same mistake again. But this is a delusion.  Investors will lose money when they believe without any concrete evidence that ‘this time it’s different’!

2) Historical Returns are important 

Past performance is not indicative of future returns – Most mutual funds and investment houses put forward this disclaimer. But past performance (I am not talking about recent past but historical data) is an important parameter to consider while investing. You cannot ignore historical performance by saying “it is different this time”. It gives some idea of the investment and the trend of returns given by the investment.

3) Valuations always matter 

There will be different bubbles and market conditions that will come and go. But the valuation of investments will remain in place. At different times, the market will be influenced by different conditions. But if your investments have been chosen after careful research, solid fundamentals and good management, the investments will stay on course in the long run. But be frank retail investors don’t have such capacities. It will be better if they have their investment policy statement &amp; stick to that in all season. [ PE Ratio is one of the valuation methods – there are many others ]

4) Human Greed 

Usually retail investors are not able to overpower greed and fear when they invest. This is not different in any part of the world. They try to put all their money in one outperforming asset. They do not exit (rebalance) from the asset at the right time in a bullish market expecting more and more gains and end up losing money. Others fear losses and do not invest in the market at all till their friend bought a car after selling scooter. Some people hold on to bad investments as they are scared of losses.

It is good to want to optimize your returns and be cautious in the market. But at different times there will be different reasons for volatility in the market. It is important to recognize that and attach the requisite importance to valuation.

---

I would just emphasize point #3, as IMHO it is the foundation for this post.  Most people who believe ""This time it's different"" believe that how we fundamentally value the market has changed.  Sometimes this is an opinion based upon research, but many times it's simply because the people uttering the phrase don't know anything about investing, and thus don't appreciate or understand what fundamental valuation is."|0.85|123|0|123|['IMHO', 'Infrastructure &amp']

If anyone is unaware a large part of the high gasoline prices we are seeing is thanks to refining margins going through the roof. The 3-2-1 crack spread which is the margin that a refiner makes on converting 3 barrels of oil into 2 barrels of oil and 1 barrel of diesel has rocketed to over $50 a barrel when pre-covid they usually sat around $20. Refining has been an area that has seen consistent low investing and Europe's refining capacity has been diminishing for over two decades. The remaining capacity in Europe is largely configured to refine Russian oil, is often owned by the Russian companies and is often positioned to receive Russian oil via pipeline. Refining capacity in the US is also shrinking although to a much lesser extent than in Europe. The last oil refinery constructed in the United States was completed in 1977 although other refineries have been expanded since then. Refineries that process more than 10,000 barrels of crude oil a day are on average 83 years old. Industry insiders say it could take ten years from the start of the process for a new refinery to come online so this doesn't seem like an investment that anyone is going to want to make. Lyondell Basell will be closing a large Houston Refinery by the end of 2023. Overall it seems likely that margins are going to stay elevated for the remainder of oil's relevance. For the year 2021 HF Sinclair($Dino) had a 3-2-1 crack spread of $21 and as I mentioned earlier the spread now is over $50. This should provide a significant boost to profits. I'm not sure about other companies but the company is projected to generate 1.5 billion in free cash flow without the increase priced in. At a current EV of 14.6 billion FCF/EV is under 10.

I know this is a fairly broad  question, but any advice would be appreciated. What determines the difference between buying high and selling low vs cutting loses on a proven loser?

My wife's 401k dumped her international index fund (think something like VXUS) and outomatically switched her into Baron Global Advantage Fund Institutional Shares. It is clearly not even closely an equivalent - basically a high risk 2/3 US, 1/3 international, tech, growth, emerging market type fund. We just left it, as her 401k had no other international options. Yes, this was our mistake and fully understand how we should have done things differently to approximate our desired asset allocation and risk tolerance. Initially, I assumed this was basically similar to VUG, but the more I look at it, I feel its closer to some wannabe ARKK thing. Expense ratio is high at 0.9%, but almost all my wife's options are 0.5% or more.

Anyway, how do you determine when its time to cut and run, after taking a BIG loss? I did ask this on bogleheads, and got a bit of a mixed bag, but the overall sentiment was to dump it. My only issue with that sub is that a lot of the advice seems all hold to a few basic rules, such as only buying the absolute lowest cost funds, or just parroting blanket statements that don't really help analyze a portfolio. A lot of times it seems they will recommend dumping a fund based on expense ratios, without taking into account things like tax implications (although this doesn't apply to my 401k issue). Anyway, I am not arguing with their advice, but would be curious what /r/investing has to say. I've seen some similar posts here that have been allowed, but if this violates any rules, you don't need to give specific advice on this fund, but maybe references or discussion on how to evaluate larger funds where it might not be feasible to evaluate each individual holding individually, as well as when to hold through the dips vs cutting your losses."|0.75|20|0|20|['Global Advantage Fund Institutional Shares']

* CEO Brian Cornell said the big-box retailer wants to clear room for the merchandise including groceries and back-to-school supplies.

* Target anticipates its operating margin rate for the second quarter will be around 2%. That’s lower than the outlook it gave less than three weeks ago.

* The company also reiterated its forecast for sales growth and said margins will look healthier in the back half of the year.


Target warned investors Tuesday that its profits will take a short-term hit, as it marks down unwanted items, cancels orders and takes aggressive steps to get rid of extra inventory.

The retailer slashed its profit margin expectations for the fiscal second quarter to account for a wave of goods winding up deeply discounted or on the clearance rack. Shares fell about 1% in early trading Tuesday.

“We thought it was prudent for us to be decisive, act quickly, get out in front of this, address and optimize our inventory in the second quarter — take those actions necessary to remove the excess inventory and set ourselves up to continue to be guest relevant with our assortment,” CEO Brian Cornell said in an interview with CNBC.

By taking swift action, Cornell said Target can fend off further pain and make room for merchandise that customers do want, such as groceries, beauty items, household essentials and seasonal categories like back-to-school supplies. He said the company’s stores and website are seeing strong traffic and “a very resilient customer,” but one who no longer shops popular Covid pandemic categories.

“We want to make sure that we continue to lean into those categories that are relevant today,” he said.

Target anticipates its operating margin rate for the second quarter will be around 2%. That’s lower than the outlook it gave less than three weeks ago, when it anticipated its operating margin rate would be roughly around its first-quarter operating margin rate of 5.3%.

In the back half of the year, Target anticipates profit margins will be in a range around 6% — better than its average performance for the fall season in the years before the pandemic began. The company said it still expects revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits for the full year and to maintain or gain market share in 2022.

Retailers from Walmart to Gap face a glut of inventory as inflation-pinched shoppers skip over categories that were popular during the first two years of the pandemic. Gap, for instance, said customers want party dresses and office clothes instead of the many fleece hoodies and active clothes the company has. Walmart said some families are making fewer discretionary purchases as the prices of gas and groceries rise. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters both reported a steep jump in inventory levels, up 46% and 45%, respectively, from a year ago from a mix of items not selling and supply chain delays easing.

The extreme shift in consumers’ spending habits comes as retailers start to get back to healthy in-stock levels. That means some have an abundance of sweatpants, throw pillows and pajamas just as consumers search for swimsuits and suitcases. Plus, some shoppers are trimming back on spending due to inflation or putting more of their dollars toward experiences like dining out and traveling.

Cornell said Target decided to roll out its new inventory plan after hearing retail competitors had similar woes. He said the company also wanted to get ahead of key sales seasons, such as back-to-school and the holidays, when stale merchandise could clutter stores and drive away customers.

Target said it had nearly $15.1 billion of inventory as of April 30, the end of the fiscal first quarter. That’s about 43% higher than in the year-ago period.

Target shocked Wall Street on May 18 with a wide earnings miss for the fiscal first quarter, as it got hit by fuel and freight costs, higher levels of discounting, and a rotation away from items like TVs, small kitchen appliances and bicycles. Its shares fell nearly 25%, marking the company’s worst day on Wall Street in 35 years.

Walmart missed earnings expectations, too. Its inventory levels were up about 33% compared with a year ago. Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said at an investor event on Friday that about 20% of that is merchandise the retailer wishes it did not have. Roughly a third is additional inventory to help the retailer restock key items. He said it will be “a couple of quarters to get back to where we want to be.”

That company’s shares also fell after Target’s announcement on Tuesday. Walmart’s shares were down about 2% early Tuesday morning.

Cornell said Target is sorting through its inventory, deciding in some cases to pack away merchandise to sell at full price in the future and in other cases to promote or come up with ways to sell through it now.

For instance, he said, Target had a big sales event over Memorial Day weekend to clear bulky outdoor items like patio furniture out of its backrooms. It also got additional space near U.S. ports to hold merchandise, so it has a place to move goods — some of which are arriving too early or too late."|0.95|577|0|577|['Walmart', 'CNBC', 'Target', 'Cornell', 'Abercrombie &amp', 'American Eagle Outfitters']

Quantum technology should be viewed as a critical enabler for industries in the future with applications including better methods of drug discovery and modeling financial markets. Nonetheless, the quantum industry is still in a very early stage. Almost all the companies outlined in this article are yet to generate material revenue from quantum technology. Over the past decade these companies have been growing out of research labs, taking on both government and private financing and committing to fundamental research to develop truly novel technologies. An investment in any of these quantum computing stocks relies on a fundamental judgment call: that we can build useful quantum computers.

Almost all of the quantum computing projects/pipelines generate trivial or zero revenue from such offerings today, and are better thought of as long-term R&amp;D projects to enable future business divisions. For example, you shouldn’t forget that Google makes its money from advertising and cloud services. With that said, if the quantum computing addressable market lives up to the hype, having a position in one of these could be a reasonable bet.

A sufficiently powerful Quantum Computer may be able to intercept many forms of modern communication we currently take for granted as being provably secure.  Quantum Security refers to both, using new types of cryptographic protocols and algorithms that are thought to be secure against a Quantum Computer and using fundamental quantum mechanical principles to secure data. 

Arqit (NASDAQ: ARQQ) is a quantum security company founded in 2016 and headquartered in London, UK. The business went public through a SPAC earlier this year and is now publicly traded. Arqit provides SaaS Quantum encryption solutions. Their source of entropy will eventually be from a satellite and symmetric key data will be stored in global data-centers. Their focus has been on building corporate partnerships with blue-chip clients.

Quantum eMotion (TSXV: QNC), is a Montreal-based developer of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) founded in 2017. QRNGs are hardware components that leverage the intrinsic unpredictability of quantum mechanics. Their purpose is to create pure randomness to ensure encrypted communication is “unhackable”. The business recently announced a patent issuance in China. 

Hub Security (TESA:HUB) is an Israeli company redefining cyber security by using quantum-powered secret computing and has been awarded FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certification, the highest level of security for cryptographic modules in the United States. Hub protects critical commercial and government information in over 30 countries by providing revolutionary cybersecurity computing solutions and a wide range of cybersecurity professional services. Recently, the company agreed to merge with SPAC Mount Rainier Acquisition Corp. (RNER) on March 23 to go public in the United States.

So why invest in quantum computing? Let's summarize, you’ll get well-diversified exposure to the quantum computing industry before it gains widespread commercialization. Quantum computers are the next leap forward in computing power. Using the power of quantum mechanics to solve certain problems, quantum computers can do things that even the biggest and best classic supercomputers in the world cannot. This nascent technology creates multidimensional spaces to represent very large problems. Quantum computers can even perform certain tasks in about one second that would take a classic supercomputer a week to perform. Given the technology's potential, it's certainly understandable why investors are excited about the future of quantum computing"|0.73|14|0|14|['Acquisition Corp.', 'HUB', 'Google', 'Quantum Random Number Generators', 'Quantum Computer', 'quantum', 'Arqit', 'Quantum', 'Quantum Security', 'QNC']

&gt; Those criticisms came into sharp focus on May 31, when German police raided the offices of asset manager DWS and its majority owner Deutsche Bank as part of a probe into allegations of greenwashing. It was the first time that an asset manager has been raided in an ESG investigation and signals a moment of reckoning for the industry.

&gt; It’s a “real wake-up call,” says Desiree Fixler, the former DWS executive who blew the whistle on her company for allegedly making misleading statements about ESG investing in its 2020 annual report (DWS denies wrongdoing). “I still believe in sustainable investing, but the bureaucrats and marketers took over ESG and now it’s been diluted to a state of meaninglessness,” she says.

&gt; On top of the allegations of greenwashing at the industry’s highest levels, there is the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is forcing companies, investors and governments to wrestle with developments that at times appear to pit the E, the S and the G against one another. For example, governments in Europe are reneging on environmental goals by turning to fossil fuels to reduce dependence on Russian gas, in order to fulfil ethical goals.

[...]

&gt; Some people wonder whether the term still has any meaning at all. “The acronym ESG is a bit of a confused compact because it muddies at least two things,” says Ian Simm, founder and chief executive of £37bn asset manager Impax Asset Management, a pioneer in sustainable development.

&gt; “One is an objective assessment, around risk and opportunity. And the other is around values or ethics. And so people get themselves tied in knots because they’re not really clear about what exactly ESG investing is about.”

The idea being that with the global financial economy being so interconnected, think 2008, 2020, and now. Does it really matter if we diversify only in US stocks, or alternatively, if we only bought Canadian stocks?

Plus, many large companies have parts of their company in different countries anyway, so in a way, you are already diversified no?

Thoughts?

Note: before you pull out a graph and say economy “x” only accounts for 5% of the global economy and what not: 

1.

I’m curious to know how you can truly determine that. Remember that a “Canadian” company does not only operate in Canada, same idea applies to the US. Do we really have an accurate way of measuring the reach of these companies? 

2.

Why does this matter? “Diversification for the sake of diversification bro” well that’s a circular argument. So long as the population, economy of that country is growing whether it be from births or immigration, the big players make their money and can continue to grow. You have your eggs in a developed country with strong institutions compared to other countries, why diversify out into some countries that are arguably not as developed in this respect? In a way, we can view this as *less* diversification if diversification is all about risk aversion. 

I guess volatility is lower by a bit, total returns though is probably a little lower for the lower risk though.

Hope this sparks some meaningful discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

# Weekly Brief for the Coming Week of 6/6/22

**The Week Behind**

Courtesy of Friday’s sell-off on the backs of MU and AAPL, all the major indices closed the week in the red. DOW down 0.9%; NASDAQ down 1.0%; S&amp;P down \~1.2%.

Highlights:

* Jamie Dimon appeared to have flip-flopped as the CEO turned weather forecaster called for anything from a category 1 hurricane to a “superstorm Sandy” after proclaiming the clouds were clearing the week before.
* Markets grappled with the 10-year retesting 3%.
* Indices reacted poorly to PMI, but positively to mixed employment data.
* The Chinese economy began reopening.
* Microsoft (MSFT) revised earnings downward as a strong U.S. dollar weighs on multinationals (FX revision).
* Bearish calls on Micron (MU) and Apple (AAPL) as DRAM prices appear to be deflating, and Apple’s app store is suffering due to slowdowns in China.

Although Friday’s session was poor, overall, the market continued its recent trend of ending up despite bad news. On Wednesday, we traded down as QT began, sending the 10 year close to 3%, and May PMI came out to 56.1%, suggesting the economy may still be hot enough to warrant additional FED tightening. However, the indices recovered pretty well by the close. On Thursday, it was MSFT’s downward FX revision and FED Vice Chair Brainard reiterating her hawkish position that caused an AM sell-off. However, by midday a bounce was underway that had enough energy for all three of the major indices to close convincingly at weekly highs. Friday, downgrades to AAPL and MU resulted in a down open without a bounce. However, the major indices refused to give back gains made in the prior week’s rally. In short, while the indices did not stage a bounce to close the week, the indices showed some resilience by refusing to fold.

**Is The Rally Intact?**

In my view, the rally is still intact, but there now arise fair questions surrounding how much steam remains. With the 10 year below 3%, S&amp;P holding 4,100, plenty of bad news priced in, and earnings holding up, I think there is more room for upside. Furthermore, it appears that the 10-year yield and investor appetite are largely dependent on the FED’s tightening path. Assuming the FED doesn’t deviate from its planned 50 bps hikes at the next two meetings, I think the market is range bound pending data relative to the FED’s action in September. Do we see a 25, 50, or 75bp hike? Do we see additional reduction of the balance sheet? Economic indicators, bellwether earning reports, and “FED Speak” is our best source of additional insight. *Given year-over-year comps for CPI get easier for the latter half of the year, there is reason to believe the FED will have some leeway to slow tightening, which is bullish for equities.*

**The Week Ahead**

Speaking of economic indicators, this week features consumer credit - 3pm, Tuesday - initial and continuing jobless claims - 8:30am, Thursday - and CPI - 8:30am, Friday. Consumer credit will provide insight on how households are handling elevated levels of food and energy inflation. A poor reading may create the perception the FED will remain aggressive in September. It would also give reason to sell consumer discretionary. As per jobs, we want a middle-of-the-road number. Too hot, the FED needs to do more to slow the economy. Too cool, the economy is falling into more than a slowdown. CPI, we want a cool core and headline to permit less aggressive action in September.

As per earnings, Dave and Buster’s (PLAY) reports Tuesday after the bell. A good number would suggest consumers are spending on “experiences”. Campbell (CPB) reports Wednesday before the open. It is considered a safe-haven in the current environment and part of an exclusive club of stocks that are positive YTD. Otherwise, Thursday after the bell is DocuSign (DOCU). The stock has been cut in half YTD. I think this company has legs post-COVID; however, it will need to deliver a compelling post-pandemic plan or commentary to change its perception as a pandemic-darling.

As previously mentioned, I think the market’s primary concern is FED action in September. Remember, the FED promised to be data dependent beyond the June and July meetings. The FED’s move in September is dependent on the health of the economy and state of inflation as illustrated through all of the data leading up to September’s meeting. While this week’s data is important, it only begins to set the table for the FED’s next move. Most simply, the FED will not be making final decisions on September based on this week’s data. I issue this reminder because the market will react in the moment, and you can expect FED members to do the same via interviews and press releases. *Don’t let an extreme response from either cause you to make an emotional decision with your portfolio.*"|0.8|12|0|12|['FED', 'MU', 'DOW', 'Campbell', 'CPB', 'Microsoft', 'PMI', 'Apple', 'DocuSign', 'DOCU', 'Sandy', 'AAPL', 'NASDAQ', 'The Rally Intact', 'Buster']

International

Small Cap Value.

Why these two choices?

International hedges against the potential total loss / underperformance of Capitol should the United States end up experiencing a lost decade. 

Small Cap Value, disregarding the long proven trend that it outperforms the market longs term, also tends to rebound quicker and out perform the S&amp;P during the beginnings of a recovery period.

Both of these asset classes have done poorly during the last decade which has made many hesitant; but that just increases my conviction that there will be a rotation into them soon and that all the reasons why they may outperform will be demonstrated soon as the US flounders through this situation.

See:

The 1970s

The 1980s

The 2000s

But I always get downvoted for suggesting this because the only asset classes that seem to matter on this website are either the speculative tech plays or VTI and chill.

IEMG is only down 13 percent YTD, VXUS 11%, and IJS 7%. While you’re still losing money somewhat, this counts as “outperforming” the broader market.

[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/education/article-whats-with-etf-distributions-that-dont-distribute-any-cash/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/education/article-whats-with-etf-distributions-that-dont-distribute-any-cash/)

So according to the above article, there are some ETFs out there that distribute part of their yearly distributions as non-cash distributions, I have so many questions that arise from this:

1. Why in the world would they do this? Isn't an ETF simply meant to give you the dividends from the underlying securities? How, where, and why would they distribute  non-dividend distributions?
2. Is this a sign of a healthy ETF, it depends, or no?
3. What are the tax implications of this? Say you invest 1000 dollars into ABC ETF at 5% yield, 2.5% of that yield is non-cash distributions. Do you pay tax on that portion on the year of or only when you sell? How are the taxes calculated?
4. What would this *look* like in terms of your ETF? Let's go back to the 1000 dollars into ABC at 5% example. Say each share you bought at 10 bucks, so you now have 100 shares. 5% yield means your distributions amount to 50 bucks. If half of that is non-cash, does that mean your ETF will magically increase the number of shares you own to 25 bucks more, so assume it is still 10 bucks a share, meaning an extra two shares? But what happens with that 5 bucks you can't re-purchase with? This all would happen without DRIP being turned on right which is weird to me. So basically your yield in cash is not actually 5%, you can get finessed and only get half of that in cash right?

t3_v5oz2p|1654470301|investing|Derivative dividend ETFs are LESS risky than normal dividend ETFs???|"Hi guys,

So first off, I'm not interested in debating the dividend irrelevancy theory. For those with a long retirement horizon, sequence risk is a big issue, and dividends from aristocrats have historically been less volatile than the overall market.

That being said, I'd like to have a discussion as to whether a global derivative dividend aristocrat ETF is actually LESS risky compared to a global non-derivative dividend aristocrat ETF.

For someone looking to draw a monthly income from the distributions, you want something that is stable month-to-month and grows at least with the rate of inflation.

That being said, to my shock, a derivative based one seems to fit this criteria better than a non-derivative one???

Compare for instance the following:

[https://ycharts.com/companies/TQGD.TO/dividend](https://ycharts.com/companies/TQGD.TO/dividend)

https://dividendhistory.org/payout/tsx/TGED/

These ETFs are very similar, the main difference is that the top one is non-derivative while the second is.

To my shock, the derivative one has MORE growth in terms of distributions and MORE stability, whereas the top one actually CUT their distributions?!?

My question is, how can this be possible? Wouldn't the addition of derivatives make this higher risk? Further, the yields are similar, the derivative is like 1% higher, meaning the majority of the yield comes from dividends. I don't get how the derivative overlay makes the ETF less risky overall. Can someone explain why? Am I missing something?

Note: I know a derivative ETF has slightly less returns in the long term, that it has higher expenses, but these are not what I'm wondering.

Investors commonly hear that when inflation surges, it is best to put your money into physical assets that track the jump in prices, with real estate often suggested as the best option. But physical assets, particularly properties, generally can’t be bought as easily or quickly as securities, and acquiring them often entails significant transaction costs.

The second-best option is usually to rebalance your stock portfolio to shift it into industries that do well in an inflationary environment. So, when inflation surges, what industries do best for a stock portfolio?

To sum up: Shares in real-estate investment trusts or companies in the real-estate industry are not the best option. Stocks in the materials and energy industries outperform all others by a long shot, according to the findings of a study I conducted with my research assistants, Zihan Chen and Yiming Xie.

The median real-estate stock delivered a 3.32% annualized return over the three periods, far below the annualized returns of 18% for the median energy company and 16.81% for the median materials company.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, healthcare (including pharmaceuticals) performed the worst, with an annualized return of minus 8.44%, followed by consumer staples at minus 6.73%, consumer discretionary at minus 5.71%, utilities at minus 4% and technology at minus 3.64%.

The negative results for healthcare, tech and consumer discretionary are understandable, because these are interest-rate-sensitive industries. But the results for consumer staples and utilities might surprise some investors, because these are often thought of as safe assets in rough times.

At the end of the day, the best move for investors who want to reposition their portfolios quickly when inflation is surging is to shift into materials and energy companies."|0.87|187|0|187|['healthcare']

&amp;#x200B;

* What is the coupon interest paid on?  For example, I could imagine the bond I am buying for $100.48 was a $10 bond (i.e. I would get 2.830% on $10 for two more interest periods). Or is it 2.830% of ask price I buy the bond for? -- Again, totally naive here!
* Within fidelity, how does it work when the bond reaches maturity? Is the principal returned immediately? Or do you need to take the bond to the seller to get the principal back?"|0.72|11|0|11|['Fidelity', 'Federal Farm CR BKS Bond']

Dividend bearing equities tended to do fairly well, ie., holding them and doing nothing made you noticeable money, but the massive multipliers were to be had in the stocks that grew independently of any dividend policy for the most part. 

Strong, market-bucking gains in value were either in companies that produced massive profits like Apple, which produced enormous wealth from its lowly shares if you bought them on the cheap, or simply experienced multiple expansion like most of the NASDAQ and much of the S&amp;P 500 regardless of their constituent dividend policies. I can think of a few dividend focused companies that have done better than the S&amp;P in this time-frame assuming dividends were reinvested, but I can't think of any one of them that did better than Apple or Google on their own.

I am curious if anyone sees a return to dividends as characterizing stock investing in the future, as it characterized so much of it in the past for a very long time, or if anyone thinks they will continue to be considered an afterthought outside of alternative investment assets like equity REITs and others which are designed to pay them higher dividends in the first place.

I'm aware of most of the arguments surrounding dividends, both in favor and against their deployment. Tax drags, inefficient capital placement, keeping management honest, letting shareholders invest where they want to with profits, more neutral observations on how the markets reduce share price by an exact ratio...

As we all know, the cardinal sin is to sell due to fear, especially when things go down. We all know this, but of course the market still crashes on average once every 10 years because people are selling more than buyers are buying at those prices.

Apparently you can hold your ETFs in through a direct registration system which is facilitated by a company called computer share?

I think a useful ratio for indicating deeply troubling times is world and US oil expenditures to GDP. The last two great market tops for oil were in 1980 and 2008, which were periods that saw some of the deepest recessions in history. Oil is still one of the bedrocks of our economy, and when it gets too expensive, spending pulls back across much of the market. Here are some previous ratios of Oil to GDP and at what percentages it historically preceded market tops and subsequent financial turmoil. 

**1980**

In 1980, oil peaked at 36$ per barrel. In 1980, the US consumed 17 million barrels per day, totaling 6.205 billion barrels a year. At 36$ per barrel, this equals $223.38 billion of oil consumption. GDP in 1980 was $2.857 trillion, making oil expenditures equal 7.81% of US GDP. The world consumed 61.23 million barrels per day (YCharts) totaling 22.3489 billion barrels per year. At 36$ per barrel, this equals $804.5622 billion against a world GDP of $11.3 trillion, making oil expenditures equal 7.12% of world GDP. The country entered a recession in 1981-1982 which was, at the time, the worst economic downturn in the United States since the Great Depression. The Dow lost 20% from peak to trough.

**2008**

In 2008, oil prices peaked at 145$ per barrel. The US consumed 19 million barrels per day, totaling 6.935 billion barrels per year. At 145$ a barrel, oil expenditures would amount to $1.005 trillion against GDP of 14.5 trillion, making oil expenditures equal 6.93% of US GDP. World consumption during this time was 86 million barrels per day equaling 31.39 billion barrels per year. At $145 per barrel, world oil expenditures would amount to $4.551 trillion against world GDP of $58.06 trillion, making oil expenditures equal 7.83% of world GDP. The country entered a recession in 2008, which is currently the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The S&amp;P lost 50% of it's value from peak to trough. 

**Presently**

In 2021, the US consumed about 20 million barrels per day, totaling 7.3 billion barrels per year. Using today's price of oil ($117; WSJ), oil expenditures equal $854.1 billion against US GDP of 23 trillion (Current dollar GDP), which makes oil expenditures equal 3.67% of US GDP. World oil demand was 99.7 million barrels per day, totaling 36.3905 billion barrels per year. At $117 per barrel, this equals $4.2576 trillion in oil expenditures against world GDP of $94.935 trillion (Statista; 2021), making oil expenditures equal 4.48% of world GDP as of the end of 2021. 

**In Closing**

We are trending upwards, but oil expenditures to GDP have a ways to go before reaching the 7-8% figures we've seen during previous financial catastrophes. There are many nuances to oil prices, but for us to reach even the 7% figures of Oil to GDP, the price per barrel of oil would need to reach \~$220/ barrel. (I’m not sure it’s this simple, but I’m trying) Now, $220/barrel seems ridiculous. The price of oil would certainly start to have hampering effects on economic growth before this level as it did with previous price run-ups,  but my point is that we could potentially see oil go much higher before we see a market top and subsequent collapse.

I am not aware of a good software to use in order to track a portfolio of equity, fixed income and crypto. This would be a performance measurement tool and ideally the holdings would be an aggregation of trades. I am looking to house and consolidate investments in one tool – being able then to have an “easy” overview of cost, performance, holdings… and dare I say it, risk!

Please list your recommendations and anecdotal information (pros and cons).

Ideally the software offers a monthly subscription, accounts on a money-weighted return and can produce reports from it. 

Morningstar portfolio management tool does not accept individual fixed income ISINs or identifiers, so this would be an example of not what to suggest.

I am unsure about the cost of SS&amp;C Geneva, but this looks like a good solution.

Something along these lines, ""affordable"" as an individual - e.g. does not exceed $1,000 per year would be good - but I am open. 

There is also Clearwater Analytics, Kubera, Personal Capital - and may others, I am just unsure about their capabilities versus cost. 

Separately, if anyone knows where I can find a library of valuation spreadsheets which I could download/pay for, in order to value a multi-asset class portfolio effectively and correctly, please suggest so!!

Anyone with experience of building something like this – feel free to reach out.

What will the world look like in 2044?|"I have some questions about the long-term growth of the stock market and the greater implications of what that growth means. I invite each of you to take a deep bong hit before following me down a path of wild speculation for pure entertainment value. 

**Setting the stage**: Let’s use the S&amp;P500 as an example and assume that it continues to grow at the 10% annual, historical growth rate. Fast forward to the year 2044, the year I personally turn 60 and roughly the time my elder millennial peers will start freaking out about retirement. 

**Napkin math incoming**: If that growth rate holds, that means that the S&amp;P500 would likely sit around 39,000 (give or take). That’s roughly a 900% increase in value from where we are in 2022. For example, Amazon's market cap is 1.27 trillion dollars. A 900% growth rate would make Amazon’s 2044 market cap 11.4 trillion dollars. Adjusting for the historical inflation rate of 3.26%, that means they would be worth roughly 5.3 trillion in today’s dollars making their inflation-adjusted market cap 4 times what it is today.    

**Future tripping**: We all know that the stock market has a long history of consistent and reliable growth and, for the sake of my question, let’s assume it continues to happen. What does Amazon look like with a market cap of 11.4 trillion? Amazon is just one example and, obviously, all/most companies would see the same or similar exponential growth. 

Would this type of sustained growth require continued monopolization and/or global expansion? What are the broader implications of that growth? What do those companies look like when they are 900% larger than they are today? What are the greater social conditions of a world with this type of corporate growth (other than thriving investments)? Paint me a picture!"|0.73|31|0|31|['Amazon', 'Napkin']

This week we are getting mixed messages about the stock market or even wonder if it is a solid place to park your savings.  Never have us seen an aggression that seems to last that long with no relief or truce insight. The inflation certainly has hit hard started with fuel prices.  I started seen $7 prices at gas pump and summer just started.  I plan to reduce my positions and put into more in recession resistant funds. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS and PLANS?

Below is the article from JP Morgan CEO. 

“It’s a hurricane. Right now, it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine. Everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,” Jamie Dimon [said during a financial conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ9ycHsXOls).

“That hurricane is right out there down the road, coming our way. We just don’t know if it’s a minor one or Superstorm Sandy or Andrew or something like that, and you better brace yourself,” he added.

The JPMorgan Chase chief executive spotlighted two issues he was concerned about: the Russia-Ukraine war and how it is affecting rising prices for fuel and food, and the Fed’s efforts to raise interest rates and reduce its balance sheet to tackle inflation, [according to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/jamie-dimon-says-brace-yourself-for-an-economic-hurricane-caused-by-the-fed-and-ukraine-war.html).

Dimon said “wars go bad” in suggesting that the Fed’s interest rate hikes could backfire and lead to a recession.

He also said the U.S. should do more to protect European economies that are being hurt by the fighting over Russia’s oil and gas supplied.

“We’re not taking the proper actions to protect Europe from what’s going to happen to oil in the short run,” he said.

The chief executive’s remarks come as the United States grapples with decades-high inflation, a nagging COVID-19 pandemic that has disrupted supply chains and further constraints on the global economy from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The Biden administration and the Fed have come under criticism for not doing more earlier to tackle inflation.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [conceded in an interview with CNN](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3507422-%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Byellen-says-she-was-wrong-about-path-that-inflation-would-take/) on Tuesday that she was “wrong” about the trajectory of inflation following comments she made in 2021 that suggested it would be a “small risk.”

“Well, look, I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,” the Treasury secretary said when asked about her comments from 2021.

“As I mentioned, there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I didn’t — at the time didn’t fully understand. But we recognize that now.”

My HSA provider is currently changing banks, and I am being forced to liquidate my HSA investment in order to transfer the funds over. I'm not upset by this, but I'm upset by the new bank's fee structure.

The current bank charges no fees for HSA investing as long as you keep your cash account at a minimum of $3000. The new bank charges at least 0.40% annually, and an additional 0.50% for a ""Managed Path"" (rather than Self-Directed Path or Brokerage Path, neither charge the extra fee).

t3_v2i8p3|1654093596|investing|Factor Investing: On the meaning of 'Diversification' and calculating tilts.|"I'm trying to understand the theory behind 5 factor models and how it relates to implementation.

So the Fama-French 5 factor model states that the difference in returns between two portfolios is explained (mostly) by 5 factors: market beta, profitability, size (large vs. small cap), growth vs. value, and investment style (aggressive versus conservative).

Now consider a 100% VT portfolio. Would this portfolio be 'undiversified' in a factor sense, since the returns are explained entirely by market beta? (even though technically you own all equities)

To then gain exposure to the size factor, you would *overweight* small cap stocks and therefore increase return. Or you could overweight value stocks to get the value factor. This means you have diversified into two factors?

But how do you diversify across *all* factors? How much small caps, value stocks, profitable stocks, and conservative investing-style stocks do you need to add? If you just end up at 2 * VT, you are back to just one factor (market beta). But you can't *only* buy small, value, profitable, conservative-style stocks or else you lose market beta.

My other big question is: based purely on factor models, how do you calculate the 'optimal' allocation? Consider the set of all portfolios with a fixed risk allocation--the expected returns are (ideally) explained by the factors. What are those weights?

I'd appreciate any concise (and mathematical) resources on this without having to directly dive into the paper."|0.88|6|0|6|['the Fama-French 5']

&gt; The Fed had to end its first QT program in September 2019 after the declining size of its balance sheet contributed to a crisis in overnight lending markets.

&gt; Come September, the Fed will be cutting $95 billion a month from its holdings, split between $60 billion of Treasuries and $35 billion of MBS.

&gt; That is roughly double the maximum pace of $50 billion a month targeted in the 2017-2019 cycle. Back then, the split was $30 billion of Treasuries and $20 billion of MBS.

&gt; When the Fed kicked off its first-ever QT undertaking, its total balance sheet was around $4.5 trillion in size. In nearly two years of QT, it managed to bring that down by about $650 billion to a bit over $3.8 trillion before it brought the program to a stop.

&gt; This time, the annualized monthly rate of reduction works out to more than $1.1 trillion a year in balance sheet roll-offs once it attains its maximum pace. That means it will likely surpass the total of the entire 2017-2019 QT cycle by early 2023. Many economists see officials targeting about $3 trillion in total balance sheet shrinkage over a three-year span.

Currently at about $9t, planning on getting rid of $3t (that's 3 years of QT... are the markets really trusting the fed at their word and pricing that in? which sectors are actually affected by QT, directly and indirectly?)

What are the chances the Fed's balance sheet ends up $6t by 2025-2026? If the government keeps spending more than they collect on taxes, they are going to keep issuing bonds to borrow money to create money to spend. What % of those bonds will the Fed purchase/hold? 0? They're going to unwind $1t a year at the same time the government needs to borrow roughly $1t a year deficit wise? If I am wrong on this, please teach me.

t3_v1xdvn|1654023332|investing|LETFS can have a responsible use case|"Hi all,

This sub had a recent thread that seemed to turn into a total echo chamber on this subject. I spend most of my time trying to tamp down the excessive optimism in r/LETFs but from what I saw irrational pessimism on these instruments is dominant here. So lets discuss, hopefully in good faith. I enjoy debating the merits of this stuff, so I intend on posting more here in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

(1) **Daily rebalancing is in and of itself a cost.** This is one big myth. As AQR points out: "" Levered portfolios require an additional  rebalancing process, but this does not cause  any special “drag” effects beyond the normal  compounding effects of investments at a similar  risk level, and some additional transaction  costs  Moderately levered portfolios of liquid  instruments can be suitable for long-term  investors, subject to their risk preferences."" All these examples of ""market goes up 10% then down 10%"" that show LETFS losing money due to so called drag involve the market mean reverting within the period described, which is tantamount to saying swing trading would beat the market! Rebalancing, aside from costs involved in doing so, is not a source of greater returns, or a market timing strategy would work. There is absolutely 0 reason to say that daily rebalancing should in general lose to, or beat, monthly rebalancing. If you have a view on that, you have a view on timing the market.  

(2) **3X leverage is needed to generate high returns.** I spend much of my time in the LETF subreddit debunking this nonsense. It is indeed true very few markets are high enough returning and stable enough to reward 3X leverage. But 2X leverage does dramatically increase returns, more than quadrupling average lump sum ending balance over 30 year periods from 1920-2021, and more than tripling DCA balances over 30 year periods from 1920-2021 (less time to compound dillutes DCA advantage) based on Robert Shiller's monthly data assuming a borrowing cost of the Fed Funds rate+85 basis points. One annoying aspect of the current LETF market is that 3X levered ETFs are cheaper than 2X levered ones, such that half in UPRO half in VOO beats all in SSO. But 85 basis points, roughly 45 per turn of leverage in management fees and 40 worth of spreads is quite reasonable as an approximation for UPRO. Download Shiller's data and assume higher fees and spreads if you want to stress test, I've done so a great deal. Even many of the more bearish users such as Modern Footblal in r/LETFS admit that 2X leverage with reasonable stock market returns does increase ending balance. 3X leverage is a whole different ballgame. 

&amp;#x200B;

(3) **There is no tax advantage to leverage** This is a key point very few people talk about. UPRO has had a tax cost basis WAY lower than SPY or VOO. This is analogous to the interest tax shield in corporate finance/private equity. They use the dividends to pay the interest costs, thus avoiding the need to distribute capital gains. Most backtests don't account for this, which arguadly would reduce CAGR of SPY/VOO by as much as 0.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

(4) **Historically US equity returns continuing is needed for leverage to work** I actually made a post in the LETF sub pointing out Shiller's arguments that we should adjust down historical stock market returns to reflect the fact that most economists don't think the US stock market performance will be repeated. But 2X leverage still handily wins in maximizing ending balance over long periods, both with DCA and lump sum, if you adjust down historical returns 1% or 2%. Moreover, the fed funds rate is unlikely to average 3.7% as it did in the past, more like 2% seems likely as a long term average, so leverage is far more likely to be rewarded. 

(5) **Risk adjusted returns are all that matter in investing.** I readily admit that LETFS will always have slightly worse risk adjusted returns than SPY, at least ignoring potential tax alpha. But if you are just looking to maximize your money far in the future, and have a good emergency fund and confidence in your ability to earn enough money to support your lifestyle, risk adjusted returns aren't necessarily the most important thing to you. If you for instance are a FIRE type DCAing into UDOW and UPRO will probably get you there quicker than SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's enough for now. I genuinely believe that the current LETFS will be a much more important area of finance in the future given it looks like low interest rates are a long term thing, and I welcome an honest discussion about them."|0.79|44|0|44|['LETFS', 'UPRO', 'SPY/VOO', 'Fed', 'Modern Footblal', 'VOO', 'WAY', 'DCA', 'SSO', 'SPY', 'Shiller']

&amp;#x200B;

Between the start of the month and May 24, insider buying at S&amp;P 500 companies has been the strongest since March 2020, according to figures from VerityData. For the broader Russell 2000 index, there have been more insider buyers than sellers this month for the first time since March 2020, VerityData said.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite retail investors pulling out of the stock market and the looming threat of a slowdown or recession, “corporate insiders are holding a non-consensus view across most sectors and \[are\] actively buying the dip”, analysts at JPMorgan said in a May 27 note, adding that the share purchases were encouraging for the direction of stock markets.

[Line chart: Net insider buying](https://archive.ph/Xoram/8b7ad801524416a019e2e59407135fd8bb58963c.avif)

&amp;#x200B;

US stocks snapped a seven week losing streak on Friday although the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is down 12.8 per cent so far this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Strong insider buying “has historically been a pretty good sign of market bottoms”, said David Giroux, portfolio manager at T Rowe Price.

&amp;#x200B;

“Insiders are saying ‘we don’t see a massive event coming’ . . . \[that\] these are really good buying opportunities,” he added. “This is just another confirming data point that should be positive for the market over six to 12 months if not longer.”

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this month Howard Schultz bought $15mn of Starbucks shares after returning as interim chief executive in March to the company he turned into a global coffee chain. It was the first insider stock buying at Starbucks since August 2018, VerityData said. Starbucks shares are down about 35 per cent so far this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Vladimir Shmunis, co-founder and chief executive of RingCentral, a web-based app company that replaces landline phones, spent $1.2mn on his first stock purchase since the company went public in 2013. RingCentral has seen its share price plunge more than 60 per cent this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Representatives from Starbucks and RingCentral did not respond to a request for comment.

&amp;#x200B;

“There is certainly message sending \[with\] buying and some of it is performative,” said Ben Silverman, research director at VerityData.

As a side note, I'm not really interested in the merits of I Bonds and such, but really want to know the nuances in what is possible.

So it seems you could double your purchase limit within a household if you take advantage of gifting. To start, you can buy $10k for yourself and every member of your household. Then you can buy $10k in GIFT bonds for your spouse and vice-versa, as long as you transfer it in a future year that they do not purchase or receive any. If you have kids, after purchasing their $10k limit for the year, each parent can purchase an additional $10k as a gift for that child as long as it is transferred and staggered to be given in a year they did not reach the limit.

The benefit would be to maximize the purchase ability for this year's rate, while sacrificing the purchase ability in a future year. But this sacrifice is irrelevant, considering that inflation may come down, and then one can transfer the i bond in that year.

So, for example for a family of 3, a scenario can be as such:

Parent 1 - Purchase $10k for themself, purchase $10k gift for their spouse, purchase $10k gift for child

Parent 2 - Same as parent 1

Chid: Parents purchased $10k limit for the year

Totalling: $70k in I bonds for the year under the current rate

https://www.wsj.com/articles/conditions-are-ripe-for-a-deep-bear-market-11653166864?mod=hp_trending_now_article_pos1

With the S&amp;P 500 briefly on Friday down 20% from its January peak, it is very tempting to start trying to call the end of the selloff. The problem is that only one of the conditions for a rally is in place, that everyone’s scared. That worked beautifully for timing the start of the 2020 rebound, but this time around may not be enough.

The other requirements are that investors start to see a way through the challenges, and that policy makers start to help. Without those, the risk is a series of bear-market rallies that don’t last, hurting dip buyers and further damaging investor confidence.

This time central bankers are scared not by falling markets or the economic outlook, but by ***inflation.*** Sure, if something major breaks in the financial system, they will refocus on finance, and a recession may prompt them to rethink rate rises. But for now, ***inflation means that falling stock prices are seen merely as a side effect of tighter monetary policy, not a reason to invoke the “Fed put” and rescue investors.***

There is nothing magical about a fall of 20%, the usual definition of a bear market. But it does crop up a lot: In the past 40 years, the S&amp;P 500 has bottomed out with a 20%-or-so peak-to-trough decline four times, in 1990, 1998, 2011 and 2018. Another four times it had far bigger losses, as true panic took hold.

***The common factor in the 20% drops was the Federal Reserve. Each time, the market bottomed out when the central bank eased monetary policy, with the stock market’s fall perhaps helping push the Fed to take the threats more seriously then it otherwise might.***

My concern is that this time could be more like 1973-1974. Just as then, the primary concern of the country is inflation, thanks to a war-related oil-price shock. Just as then, the inflationary shock took hold when the Fed had rates far too low given the scale of political stimulus for the economy. Just as then, favored stocks—the Nifty Fifty, now the FANGS and associated acronyms—had soared in prior years.

Most important, in 1974 the ***Fed kept raising rates even as a recession took hold because it was running to catch up with inflation. The result was a horrible bear market interspersed with soul-destroying temporary rallies, two of 10%, two of 8% and two of 7%, each snuffed out. It took 20 months before the low was reached—not coincidentally, when the Fed finally began to get serious about cutting rates.***

Now if that is correct, I would have to reduce my taxable income(through 401k/hsa contributions etc) by 40k to avoid the 22% tax on roughly half of my gross salary for the year? It just feels like I'm missing something or not understanding correctly 

And I do realize that even if I maxed my hsa and 401k, I still wouldn't reach the roughly 40k I'd need to reduce my tax bracket

Google did not give me answers I wanted which brings me to you.. 

When I switch my contributions to 401k from Traditional to Roth or vice versa, what happens? My employer is using fidelity, and I can see that there was no new 401k account created when I made this switch. 

\- Does this mean that my traditional, and Roth contributions are consolidated into one account under my employer? 

\- Does fidelity keep track of how much of the funds in the same account are pre-tax vs post-tax? I was not able to find any info on my account.  

\- For IRA, I need to create a separate account for Roth and Traditional, right? I'm basically expecting similiar behavior for 401k but I'm still seeing only one account for my employer and it's not clear to me whether this account is Traditional or Roth.

The store sells brands including Calvin Klein, Lacoste, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, Champion and Levis. Popular brands, including Amazon's own clothing line.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Business Insider, customers can buy men's and women's clothing, shoes and accessories in-store.

&amp;#x200B;

This offline store has a barcode on each shelf, which customers can scan with their mobile phones and enter the Amazon App, where they can choose to try on various types of clothing or buy directly.

&amp;#x200B;

After choosing to ""try on in the fitting room"", Amazon Style's in-store employees will deliver the clothes to the fitting room and notify customers on their mobile phones to go directly.

&amp;#x200B;

The fitting room has been transformed into a walk-in closet with a plethora of touchscreens. If customers are already in the fitting room, they can search for their favorite clothes through the touch screen, check the style selection, customer reviews, and get personalized recommendations. Customers can use the Amazon App to notify the clerk to send their selected clothes to the fitting room. , this design saves customers the trouble of walking around the store with try-on clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

The clothing records scanned by customers in the Amazon Style store can be saved in the app, and if customers change their minds, they can order online directly at home. Customers can also send the clothes they see on Amazon’s website to the Amazon Style fitting room with one click, and unsuitable items can be returned directly in the store.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Simoina Vasen, managing director of Amazon Style, Amazon Style's clothing ranges from basic models of $10 to high-end models of $500. Behind the brick-and-mortar store, Amazon has set up a large warehouse with abundant inventory.

I was also thinking about only paying off 75% of it as I have a very low interest rate (3%) and investing the rest when the market bottoms out. Thoughts?

Edit: thanks for all the comments y’all. This forum seems to be very evenly split across 3 options: 

1. Pay whole mortgage off
2. Pay some mortgage off (including option to recast), invest some (50/50)
3. Invest all (DCA/conservative investments)

I went ahead and used 66% of the gain to pay down my mortgage and will invest 34% more in I-bonds, DCA, and another investment arm I have access to. This was close to my original plan and was somewhat validated by this forum.

The house I am in right now as my primary is not my forever home, but my forever home will undoubtedly cost more so I’m comfortable putting a large sum of money towards the mortgage since that housing expense will be larger in the future when I eventually trade up anyway. Better to have more of a principal paid off for when I trade up in the future as well since interest rates on a future home will be sky high. (I live in the highest COL area in the world btw.)

Another note I will make is that I didn’t have to pay cap gains on the gains from the sale of the income property because it was my primary for the first 2 of the last 5 years before I rented it out."|0.85|501|0|501|['DCA', 'COL']

This is our ""Mad Money"", about a third of our invested assets (not including house). Sorted by weight, dollar amounts omitted.

This is about half taxed and half in IRAs, which lets me take advantage of tax loss harvesting.  We're within 5-10 years of retiring, but then again we both love our jobs so that may not be in the cards.

The ""CASH$"" is not really cash, it's a mix of VCSH and SPLB, which is where I keep the dry powder.  (And a bunch of that is currently tied up with sold puts in VTI at $195 and $200 strike prices, at least for 20 more days.)

I guess you'd slot me in the value/dividend strategy. The average div% in the IRA is about 6%, vs. 3.2% in the taxed half. (this would be so much freakin easier if we could upload an image.....this text only crap is silly.)

t3_uzoxcy|1653749575|investing|The Benefits of Diversified Investing across different Asset Classes - A simple backtest of a low-risk portfolio through all market conditions|"Hope this post might be helpful particularly for newer investors or people that want to invest but aren't really comfortable with the level of risk on equities, or who struggle to push their money in because they are afraid of a downturn soon after. I want to show you that you can still achieve good returns with low risk. In fact your risk-adjusted returns can be clearly superior.

We all know that stocks tend to offer the highest possible returns in the long run, but the problem is that stocks come with a level of drawdown risk &gt;50%. This can be very problematic for people who are not comfortable with the idea of high drawdown. It is even more problematic for people who think they are comfortable with high risk but then find out when it happens, that they are not. This puts you at risk of committing the cardinal sin of investing – which is cashing out at a hefty loss, and not only locking in a loss, but locking yourself out of future recovery and eventual gains. 

Every investor must honestly appraise the level of risk they are taking and find a level which they are genuinely comfortable with in order to avoid the cardinal sin. The problem that creates is that you have to compromise on expected returns, but IMO too many people don’t properly explore the middle ground and understand the compromise can be net beneficial and individually tailored to suit.

Diversifying between asset classes exposes you to different levels of return and risk, but critically offers you assets which are uncorrelated or perhaps somewhat negatively correlated. This leads to the so-called ‘diversification gain’. The diversification gain is essentially the benefit you receive by never taking a massive drawdown. It is better to be taking moderate returns on a consistently larger amount of money than higher returns on a potentially much smaller amount of money. Perhaps not in terms of absolute return in the long-long run, but we’ll come to that later.

So what are the asset classes we are going to look at? I have chosen US Stock Market, US Intermediate Term Treasuries, Gold, and Cash. The comparison is simple – we’ll look at 100% stocks (the high benchmark), 100% cash (which will show you why you need to invest), and a balanced portfolio. The balanced portfolio is 45% US stocks, 32% treasuries, 8% gold, and 15% cash.

Now, before any jumps on me – yes, that is conservative. And yes, there are other classes that could be included, and yes this weight to that or that weight to the other might be ‘better’, but not the point of the post. The point is to simply look at the benefit of diversification on risk control and the compromise on returns, and what can be achieved even with a conservative approach, which I personally found surprisingly good.

I will just say a word about cash, though – the idea of cash being there is because most people, especially risk-averse people, do want to keep some cash and there is often a real-life potential need for it (unemployment, unexpected expenses etc.). It is also surprising how good the returns can be in spite of keeping cash. Further, it avails you of rebalancing opportunities, something 100% stock investors simply do not have, but I’m not going to get into that here and I’ll mention why at the end.

The backest will be done as far back as it can be done on [this tool]( https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/), which is 1972. It is very helpful that we can go back to the 70s, because we can walk through a period of high inflation and tightening monetary policy. Too many backtests only look at the post-1987 easy money era, or even the post-2008 QE era. These tests will give misleading results if the monetary conditions change. However, I’ll also show results for those to show the compromise is not too great.

So, [these are the portfolios]( https://imgur.com/a/dD5iBhS). Portfolio 1 – 100% stocks, Portfolio 2 – the balanced approach, Portfolio 3 – 100% cash (which is cash earning about what it would in a savings account btw). Portfolio 2 is rebalanced annually.

And [these are the results from 1972 until April 2022](https://imgur.com/a/PgAR4TL) – a 50 year investment horizon.

Your eyes are perhaps jumping right to the final returns, but this isn’t where they should be. Why? Firstly, you cannot be 100% stocks into retirement otherwise you are risking &gt;50% drawdown on the day you retire, and if that happens you aren’t retiring. You are going back to work until that 50% is back one way or another (or slightly less considering you get older in the meantime). If you’re relying on the market, good luck, you now need it to go up 100% to make your money back and this might take a long time.

The second reason is that you can still achieve the same return by stretching the investment horizon out, i.e. you consciously accept you might have to retire a few years later, but that your date will be better known, and your life will be much less stressful. It is impossible to chase early retirement by constantly pursuing high returns without risking much later retirement. A sensible rebalancing strategy towards conservative assets as you get close to retirement is the best approach, but again it’s not going to be covered here.
In this case, a 59 year investment horizon instead of a 50 year investment horizon would approximately equalize the returns between portfolios 1&amp;2. This is not in itself desirable, but what do you get for it?

The key is the lower drawdown. Portfolio 2 risks 20%, portfolio 1 risks 50%. That is a huge difference. And what is the difference in growth? Portfolio 1 has a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 10.5% and portfolio 2 has a CAGR of 8.9%. So really, that’s a lot of extra risk for a small overall improvement in performance. It is true that bit extra makes a big difference in the end, but then you have to face the problems of the previous paragraphs.

What really strikes me is the smoothness of portfolio 2’s equity vs portfolio 1. It’s just a pretty much constant gain with only gentle drawdowns. Look at the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. The Sharpe ratio is measure of deviation from risk-free return, the higher the deviation the lower the Sharpe. The Sortino ratio is similar but only considers downside risk – it shows how much excess return you are getting per unit of risk (if we consider risk to be drawdown) – in my mind it is the more useful indicator here.
What is also notable is that there have been periods where portfolios 1&amp;2 have approximately equalized. In 2008, portfolio 2 actually became the better performer, 36 years after the start of backtest. That’s kind of incredible considering the respective risks. Astonishingly, this result still occurs if you start the backtest at a very favourable time for portfolio 1, which I’ll show below. 

A word on data-framing. So yes, in 1974 there was a big downturn on the stock market and maybe it’s not fair to start the backtest in 1972. So let’s make this very flattering for the stock market and start in 1988, after the 1987 crash, and heralding the start of the modern easy money era with Greenspan deploying QE and the Fed put for the first time.
[It’s really not that bad for portfolio 2]( https://imgur.com/a/SBBsw9j). Portfolio 1 has a notably higher CAGR, but still much greater risk, and the Sharpe and Sortino ratios indicate portfolio 2 is the better risk-adjusted performer. And again, there was a period of merging the last time the stock market suffered. And this is if we really frame portfolio 1 favourably. 
[Now let’s do the opposite, and compare since the top of DotCom in 2000]( https://imgur.com/a/DNPpGmi). Portfolio 1 still has it’s nose out in front, but only fairly recently, and the smoothing which portfolio 2 provides is now starkly apparent. Look at the consistency of portfolio 2’s curve (and remember, there is 15% cash in here, during an era of historically low rates!). Portfolio 2 is clearly the best risk-adjusted performer. The Sharpe and Sortino ratios are incomparably better.

By now you should see that in all conditions a balanced approach yields moderate-good returns with low drawdown, whereas all equities offers a higher CAGR but at the expense of much greater risk. Assessed by risk-adjusted return, the balanced approach is clearly superior.

So that’s about it really. I’m aware that we can tinker with this and that, but my point is just to show what diversification brings, and the returns that can still be had even with a very conservative weight that includes 15% cash and 8% gold.

I hope it helps some people who aren’t really sure what to do by giving them some perspective and a viable approach. If you buy portfolio 2, you sleep well at night, you don’t worry and you don’t make mistakes. You make moderate amounts of money most of the time, and you risk only about 20%. You can keep your investments liquid and draw on them if needed. You also have a consistent approach to take to retirement. Further, you can also think about rebalancing strategies, which if performed well, can even further improve portfolio 2, but I am going to leave this because it’s not necessary and is timing to some degree. I’d encourage you to play around with the portfolio tool if you want to tweak it to something which is perfect for you personally.

t3_uyzkok|1653662100|investing|I believe we are entering a decade of shortages|"**Natural Resource Holdings**

I've become extremely interested in energy markets since the onset of the Covid Pandemic. I've become so amazed that such a critical lifeblood of the economy and humanity could briefly trade negative. My interest has led me to start building positions in E&amp;P companies, base metal miners, precious metal miners, uranium producers, and agricultural companies (both fertilizer and seed/agricultural chemical companies.) 

You may feel like the time to invest in such companies has passed given the recent run-ups in commodity prices, but I believe the time to do so is just beginning. I believe the true nature of shortages, especially in energy markets, haven't and won't fully materialize until \~2025. As shortages in energy markets materialize, prices will run up more than anyone expects. 

As an extension of price run-ups in critical fuels and feedstocks, further price run-ups will occur in food and fertilizer markets, agricultural chemical markets, industrial gas markets, base and precious metals markets and to try and combat price increases across critical goods, the US will begin to heavily invest in E&amp;P and refineries for the first time in more than a decade. I believe companies with hard assets providing inelastic goods will, unfortunately, be the best performers through the decade.

**Energy Abundance**

For the last 10 years, we have lived through one of the most energy-abundant periods in history. This energy abundance has come primarily from the productive capacity increases of the US stemming from the shale revolution. 

The US has gone from exporting \~2000 barrels a day in 2010 to over \~8000 barrels a day as of 2021. The same goes for Natural Gas. In 2010, the US exported 1,173 bcf of Natural Gas. That number has ballooned to over 6,653 bcf of Natural Gas today. 

Never before has the US focused it's natural gas production efforts in so few fields. The Marcellus, Haynesville and Permian Shale Gas formations account for over 50% of US Natural Gas production. The Permian Oil field in Texas accounts for \~50% of oil production as well. 

**Field Lifecycle**

*Goehring and Rozencwagj published this info in their quarterly letter, I'm just summarizing. This is not my research.* 

Just like every other Natural Gas (and oil) formation in history , production ramps up, plateaus, and then dramatically declines. The Barnett and Fayetteville fields had estimated total reserves of 23 tcf and 10 tcf respectively. Both fields produced half of their estimated reserves around 2013. Barnett peaked at 5 bcf/d in \~2013 and then began to slowly decline to 2 bcf/d today. Fayetteville peaked at 3 bcf/d in \~2013 and then began to decline to 1 bcf/d today. 

A concept I've only recently learned, and was made aware of by a natural resource fund I follow, Goehring and Rozencwagj, is known as the Hubbert Linearization. It estimates the logistic growth rate and the quantity of the resource to be recovered. Historically, oil and gas producing fields have plateaued after half of their recoverable reserves have been extracted. Production would ramp up before reaching a peak, plateau at the peak for roughly 2 years, and then would begin to decline mirroring the ramp-up phase creating a bell-shaped curve. 

According to the Hubbert Linearization, The Marcellus formation will eventually recover 135 tcf of Natural Gas. To date, 65 tcf have been extracted, which means we may start seeing a plateau as early as this year and declines in 2025. The Haynesville field is harder to estimate as their production was tempered down for a period and then ramped back up again. Estimates from the quarterly letter, however, put recoverable reserves at 73 tcf with 30 tcf extracted to date. Given current production, 50% recoverable reserves are estimated to be reached in 2023 and declines will begin in late 2024. 

**Convergence of US and International Natural Gas Prices**

Europe has historically paid higher energy prices. This is due to them not being able to come close to meeting domestic demand with domestic production, making them and Asia net importers. The US on the other hand has enjoyed ultra-low natural gas prices since the start of the shale revolution in 2006. 

To put this in perspective, the price of US Natural Gas hasn't been above $10 per mmBtu in the last 10 years. Europe on the other hand, given the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, hit $45 per mmbtu while Asia reached nearly $75 per mmBtu. This is $300 barrel of oil equivalent and over $400 barrel of oil equivalent, respectively. 

Because the US is able to produce all of it's domestic needs and import some from other cheap producers, we've essentially lived on a price island, remaining insulated from international prices. Any meaningful slowdown in Marcellus, Haynesville or Permian production will quickly cause US prices to more closely match international prices. This makes natural gas producers particularly attractive as equity holdings, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 

**Interconnectedness of Fossil Fuel and Food Markets**

Natural gas is a critical feedstock for industrial gas markets, and by extension, fertilizer and food markets. Natural Gas and coal are used to create the inputs needed for the Haber Bosch Process. The Haber Bosch Process is the main industrial process for the production of ammonia. 

Through a process called Steam Methane Reforming, Natural Gas and steam (and pressure) are reacted to separate hydrogen from carbon to create hydrogen gas. Hydrogen and Nitrogen from the air are fixed in a high pressure, high heat environment (around 800 degrees fahrenheit, also heated by coal or nat. gas) with a catalyst (usually iron or nickle) to create liquid ammonia. The liquid ammonia is then used to create the nitrogen-based fertilizers our world depends on. Approximately 3-5% of the natural gas produced globally is utilized for ammonia production. This figure represents nearly 1-2% of the global energy supply. Approximately 1.2% of the world's energy is used for fertilizer production, of which 93% is nitrogen-based fertilizer (because it is the most effective.)

Crop yields are responsible for our cooking oils (also dependent on fossil fuels, since hexane is used for solvent extraction) and our production of animal protein. As economies industrialize, populations begin moving from grains to protein, and to produce this protein, large crop yields are needed to produce animal feed. 

Another critical shortage the world is experiencing is diesel. Diesel is the most efficient fuel for producing high torque at low-rpm, which makes it the best option for powering farm machinery as well as long-haul trucking. The covid recovery saw demand snap back with a vengeance, so transportation demand spiked to ease supply chain issues. To properly refine diesel, gas is needed to produce hydrogen, which is used to de-sulfur distillates so it can be used in engines. With pricey natural gas, diesel is getting more expensive to refine. 

Another agricultural price increase occurring as a result of higher energy prices is ""glyphosate,"" the main ingredient in the weed-killer round up. Roundup is used by farmers nationwide to tend their field in farming off-seasons, and the potential damage to fields from skipping a season could be great. 

At a time when Russia and Belarus' potash and potassium is removed from world markets, Ukraine is predicted to miss a harvest entirely, and protectionist policies are beginning to run rampant, fertilizer and agricultural chemical companies will, unfortunately, enjoy significant pricing power, since food is the most inelastic good of all. 

**In Closing** 

I'd love for a day to come when we no longer need to rely on fossil fuels, but I believe we've gone about trying to minimize them in the worst way possible. Europe is especially feeling the pain now, as their focus on rolling out solar and wind farms, while simultaneously shutting down nuclear power plants, has left their country in an energy deficit. The US has pledged 5 bcf/d to try and make up for the shortfall in Russian energy, but meeting this demand has significant logistical challenges. Both Europe and the US will be in a horrible spot if there is a slowdown in any of our top fields. 

Natural gas transports very differently from oil. It isn't extracted in liquid form, so it must be chilled and liquefied at special facilities, transported on LNG carriers that can keep it in liquid form, and regassified at special facilities at the destination so it can be burned for energy. Both Europe and the US are short the ships, the liquefaction, and the gasification facilities. Europe seems to be in a painful spot, especially if harsh winters are on the horizon. 

Bear markets have a way of returning capital to it's rightful owners. Our era of easy money is coming to an end, so the days of capital chasing the stocks of unprofitable companies is also coming to an end. I believe the US will need to invest significantly in E&amp;P over the next decade, and companies with hard assets will outperform for the foreseeable future."|0.54|4|0|4|['nat', 'Diesel', 'LNG', 'Natural Gas', '\\~2025', 'Hydrogen', 'International Natural Gas Prices*', 'Permian Shale Gas', 'US Natural Gas', 'Steam Methane Reforming', 'Nitrogen', 'the Haber Bosch Process', 'Haynesville']

t3_uyza6h|1653661254|investing|Can someone explain I-Bond rates?|"As the title says, can anyone please explain how I-Bond rates work to me? I've visited the treasury site, and it doesn't really make sense to me how they get the composite rate. Please forgive formatting as I'm on mobile.

So the composite rate comes from: 

Composite rate = [fixed rate + (2 x semiannual inflation rate) + (fixed rate x semiannual inflation rate)]

Why is the composite rate not just the fixed rate + semiannual rate? Where do each component in the parentheses come from? Why is it 2 x the semiannual rate, when that rate only lasts for a single semiannual (6 month) period?

Additionally, their historic rates don't match their own equation. I'm pretty decent at math (although I admit I don't know much about finance math), but I've used their equation on a few samples and didn't get their composite rates. Example is May 2009, where the fixed rate was 0.1% (.001), and the inflation rate was -2.78% (-0.0278).

Composite rate = [.001 + (2 x (-.0278)) + (.001 x (-.0278))]

= [.001 + (-.0556) + (-.0000278)]
= .001 - .0556 - .0000277
= -.0546278

So the composite rate for May 2009 SHOULD have been -5.46 percent. Now since I-Bonds never go negative for a composite rate, the rate should have been 0%. According to the treasury website, the composite rate for May 2009 was 9.72%.

t3_uyoymm|1653621972|investing|Never received CRM stock split compensation - Am I understanding it wrong?|"So I bought 7 call contracts of WORK back in Dec of 2020. Then the stock merger happened. So currently I have 7 contracts of CRM1. Here is how Robinhood explained what should happen:

*1) 7* [*salesforce.com*](https://salesforce.com/) *inc. (CRM) Common Shares*

If we export oil on the daily to countries like Canada &amp; Mexico (amongst many others), why do we also import oil on the daily from those same countries??

I've been reading numerous articles on how the Biden administration isn't ruling out oil export bans in order to curb prices at the pump. Apparently we consume 20m barrels per day of our own oil, and export 8.6m per day of our own oil (so exports &gt;25%). 

I understand we want to support countries and Europe and elsewhere who are more reliant on Russia at this time. The concept of an oil export ban seems controversial, and we don't need to get into that. Just focus on the topic at hand...

If we export oil to a country, just to turn around an import oil, what's the point!? Should I view this as something similar to Federal Funds and overnight lending? Where each country is just trying to ensure they have sufficient oil stores each day? Or is this a profit grab?"|0.8|48|0|48|[]

t3_uyggm0|1653596149|investing|Some tips on careful investing - from my experience|"  

1. Never follow others advices blindly. Take them with a grain of salt. You are solely responsible for your actions. My strategy is for long term investment. Not for short term.
2. Prepare a wish list of stocks/ETFs that you want to buy and keep monitoring these watch lists as frequently as possible for the best time to buy these. 
3. Buy a few good index funds and ETFs to begin with. Slowly you can focus on individual stocks once you are comfortable.
4. Buy these in installments. Set a cap for the max amount you can invest for a given stock and DO NOT cross that on a single day. For e.g. $300, $500, $1K etc. Now that there is NO charge for buying and selling stocks/ETFs in most places, you can buy these in any quantity any number of times. Even some brokers allow fractional stock tradings.
5. Go for stable and big companies. Check P/E, EPS, Dividend income etc. Set a market cap limit for a company. For e.g. $1B. Don’t invest in small companies as they might be too risky. Also don’t go for penny stocks. Better to buy stocks that are traded above $10.
6. If you are using a tax paying account, try to do tax harvesting by doing bottom fishing when good opportunities come. Look for good opportunities to buy them at lower cost i.e. when they announce a bad quarter results or due to an analyst comment etc.
7. Found Yahoo Finance’s 52-wk High Chg % and 52-wk Low Chg % metrics very useful to identify the buying opportunities. For e.g. when they reach bottom or top 10% range you can buy/sell a few.
8. Take advantage of sudden market fluctuations i.e. when markets go down by 500 points or 1000 points due to certain news. You can grab some good ones from your wish list on these good times.
9. Not advisable to buy stocks on that day they are listed (new IPOs). You can buy them after one or two quarters once all the initial hype is over and rate stabilizes.
10. Paper money can vanish just like that without much notice. Book profits as and when time is right by selling a few, but never sell off all your holdings unless you are totally sure. Sell in installments. 
11. It is a good idea to buy a stock before it splits at right time. After splitting, it has a tendency to go much higher. 
12. Fear and greed run stock market. When many are selling stocks with fear, we may need to go against the grain and pick ONLY good stocks. When a stock is pushed too high with greed, we may have to prune a little bit to book some profits.
13. Most of the times, after announcing quarterly results, stock crashes even though they announce good results but due to bad forecasting of future results. If you believe in this stock, this may be a good opportunity to buy as most of the times these companies give very pessimistic outlook though they might do a little better than what they forecast."|0.76|126|0|126|['ETFs', 'EPS', 'Dividend']

Looking for advice regarding my 401k allocations among assets classes, which I can start contributing to as of July 1. Planning on maxing out contributions and only 6 months left to do it, so while it is dollar cost averaging, it will be double the normal contribution than if I annualized.

With this in mind, and the markets current condition, I am floating around a few ideas:
1) have 100 percent of it go to a savings or fixed income fund til we see more that happens in the coming months and after, start allocating to equities as the market plays out (early next year start moving money around within 401k plan)

2) follow my normal pattern of investing 85% equities (index fund) 15% fixed income, investing as usual

3) more conservative approach, 50% in equities and 50% in savings or fixed income fund for now, and then start moving some fixed income to equities til I get the 85/15 mix.

I’m 42 and would like to be in a good position to buy a home next year, and do have some debt but want the tax savings and to get back on track with contributing. Company had me wait 14 months before I could contribute, so that’s a bummer.

While I know I can’t perfectly time the market, I think now may be a good time to be cautious and not follow my normal pattern, especially since it’s double the amount I am contributing since I only have 6 months to max it out for 2022.

Oppenheimer Says These 2 Stocks Could Surge Over 50% From Current Levels

When it comes to the market’s wild swings, is the glass half empty or half full? Oppenheimer’s chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus is taking the latter view.

Despite the volatility that has ruled the market this year, Stoltzfus describes a situation that nevertheless still brings high potential for investors willing to shoulder the risk. He writes: “While conditions are likely to remain somewhat unstable near term we’d expect investable opportunities to surface whenever ‘babies are thrown out with the bath water.’”

Stoltzfus notes a market environment facing multiple headwinds, frequently shifting crosswise to each other, making it difficult for investors to locate and follow the main path. On the positive side, however, the strategist believes that the Federal Reserve will likely play a calming role, and not just to due to its anti-inflationary policy switch.

“Federal Reserve hike cycles are never easy to navigate but the Bernanke legacy created a highly sensitive and communicative Fed, which could prove helpful... A Fed that can pivot and ‘pump the brakes’ rather than ‘slam on the brakes’ is a good thing in our view,” Stoltzfus added.

Turning Stoltzfus’ outlook into tangible recommendations, Oppenheimer 5-star analysts are pounding the table on two stocks, with these pros seeing over 50% upside potential in store. Using [TipRanks’ database](https://www.tipranks.com/), we learned that the rest of the Street is in agreement, as both boast a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus.

Some choice sound bites that I found interesting, if not LOL:

* While we can reduce estimation uncertainty by gathering more or better information, economic uncertainty is harder to mitigate. “I’m going to give you some bad news,” Damodaran said. “Ninety percent of the uncertainty we face in valuation is economic uncertainty. No amount of homework or data is going to allow it to go away.”

* Step 1: “A good valuation is a marriage between stories and numbers,” he said. “When you show me the valuation of a company, every number in your valuation has to have a story that’s attached to it. And every story you tell me about a company has to have a number attached.”

We’re drowning in detail. I see valuations that often run to 300-line items and 15 worksheets. Let it go.”

* Step 3: Focus on 6 factors: (1) revenue growth, (2) target operating margin (to capture profitability), (3) sales-to-invested-capital ratio (to reflect how efficiently growth is captured), (4) risk: cost to raise equity, (5) risk: cost of debt, and finally (6) risk: probability that the company will fail. A discounted cash-flow analysis assumes an on-going concern. That needs to be weighted by the probability that the concern won't go on.

Value stocks are stocks that are largely ignored because they are either in a dying industry, financially fragile or have very unfavorable market sentiment.This potentially makes them mispriced to the downside due to a market overreaction to their misfortunes.

Growth stocks tend to be sexy,popular and expensive...thus have LOWER expected returns than value stocks. Many good things about their growth story and financial health tend to be already known and priced in by the market.
 
During a correction value stocks tend to go down way more than growth because large growth companies tend to be seen as safer and more financially stable.

&gt;Snap shares plunged 40% on Tuesday, putting the company on pace for its worst day ever and dragging down other social media and digital ad company stocks.

&gt;The tumble comes after Snap issued a warning on Monday to investors saying it won’t meet its own targets for revenue and adjusted earnings in the current quarter.

&gt;“Since we issued guidance on April 21, 2022, the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated,” the parent company of Snapchat said in an SEC filing. Snap’s shares are down about 83% from a 52-week high in September 2021 and are off 70% year to date.

&gt;The filing also led its peers with a heavy reliance on advertising down in the afternoon. Shares of Meta were down more than 8%, Roku fell more than 15% and Pinterest dropped over 24%. Alphabet and Twitter dipped 6% and 3%, respectively.

&gt;Snap’s warning is also impacting the ad tech industry. The Trade Desk fell 18%, Magnite slipped 12% and PubMatic is also down more than 13%.

&gt;“We expect all online ad platforms to feel some impact of a significant consumer pullback,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Tuesday note to investors. “Advertising is cyclical.”

&gt;Fears around inflation, interest rate concerns, continued supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine have forced some advertisers and brands to rethink ad spend in the current quarter. Companies, including Snap, have been pressured into slowing hiring and cutting back costs in an effort to make up for losses.

Renewed growth in gold ETFs have supported recovery-analyst

Dollar hits fresh one-month low

Gold prices rose to their highest in two weeks on Tuesday, with the safe-have metal benefiting from a wilting U.S. dollar and as Treasury yields declined on subdued risk appetite.

&amp;#x200B;

Spot gold (XAU=) rose 0.6% to $1,863.69 per ounce by 10:50 a.m. ET (1450 GMT), after hitting its highest since May 9 at $1,868.69 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures (GCv1) rose 0.8% to $1,863.00.

&amp;#x200B;

Weakness in the dollar index along with a fall in U.S. Treasury yields from their recent highs has provided a supportive environment for gold, said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.

&amp;#x200B;

The greenback hit a one-month low, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also edged lower as weakness in equities revived safe-haven demand for the debt.

&amp;#x200B;

""Gold traders are increasingly questioning the Fed's willingness to hike into a recession, as growing economic concern is breathing life into the gold market. Upside flow from CTAs along with renewed growth in ETFs have supported the recovery,"" analysts at TD Securities wrote in a note.

&amp;#x200B;

The yellow metal is seen as a safe store of value during times of economic crisis and a hedge against inflation, but rising interest rates tend to weigh on non-yielding bullion.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the Federal Reserve has delivered half-of-a-percentage point rate hikes \[in June and July\] as Chair Jerome Powell has signaled, ""a pause in September might make sense,"" as per Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic.

""Now that we know what we're getting out of the Fed, you could argue that gold once again has a fairly clear path moving forward,"" Meger added, highlighting the market still questions whether the rate hikes would be enough to stave off inflationary pressures in the short term.

t3_uwrsaa|1653401561|investing|Is investing worth it, considering tax and home loan|"Hi all,

I've done a few google searches about investing and they all seem to be asking the same basic question - ""is investing my $1,000 worth it to make 5% P.A?"".

What I find those questions are missing is a few considerations, which I believe are true to most adults in the 25-45 bracket, mainly:

* Most of us pay interest on our home/apartment loans. Let's say this is around 5% P.A.
* Whenever we make any revenue from dividends on our investments, these are taxed, let's say around 35% (considering you are making a healthy wage in your day to day job)

So when considering the above, it seems that even if we are making 5% off dividends, after tax, this would end up being around 3.25% and considering that not having this money in your home loan offset account is costing your 5%, it seems that making the same % from the dividends as your home loan, actually ends up costing you more money than it makes.

I understand that there's some value in share value going up over time, however that obviously has inherent risk associated with it and is not guaranteed, but even considering an on-average healthy share price growth, accounting for capital gains tax on top of that, makes it seems quite unappealing.

I can see that having a passive income later on in life makes investing into low-risk shares quite appealing. I can also see that it could be a great thing to do if I was a stay-at-home mum/dad with no/little income. I can also understand that investing into shares is great, if the person investing does not have any outstanding debts and is simply looking to do something with their money, that would be otherwise sitting in their bank account, making 0.5% P.A., if that.

**TL;DR:** Am I missing something? Does investing into shares as a home-loan-owner that also makes a decent wage, just seem not worth it?

**P.S.** I haven't invested anything in my life, but I have been toying with the idea for a while.

t3_uw40u6|1653322911|investing|Can BABY Solve The Formula Shortage?|"As the formula shortage continues to grip the US, many parents have been left struggling to access the product they rely on to feed their babies. At the start of May, 43% of baby formula was out of stock at retailers, according to Datasembly, a product data firm. One mother, speaking to the New York Times, described the situation as “a nightmare”.

Here’s a look at how the problem started, what parents can do and what the FDA and government are doing to try to end the shortage.

In February, Abbott Laboratories, maker of popular baby formulas, closed a manufacturing facility in Sturgis, Michigan, after it recalled infant formula products when a federal investigation started after four babies taking the formula developed bacterial infections, two of whom died. Abbott has said there is no link between its formula and the illnesses. Baby formula was already being affected by pandemic-related supply chain problems, but the Michigan plant closure “really exacerbated things”, said Dr. Christopher Duggan, director of the Center for Nutrition at Boston children’s hospital.

Dr. Ann Kellam's, a University of Virginia faculty pediatrician and board president of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, explains: “This is a really difficult situation to be in. It’s hard enough to be a parent to a baby, infant or toddler, and it’s OK to use a different brand of formula than you’re used to using.” For children with a medical condition that is treated with formula, however, parents must talk with their pediatrician or a pediatric registered dietitian to ensure a switch will be safe and well tolerated, said Duggan.

If a mother has been partially breastfeeding and their baby is four months old or younger, there are also ways to boost production but parents should see a lactation consultant or breastfeeding medicine physician, said Kellam's, whose organization published a list of recommendations.

However, families could soon see some relief. The FDA and Abbott have reached a proposed settlement that would allow the company to reopen the closed Michigan facility, with oversight from an independent expert, according to the agency. The company stated it could restart the site within two weeks and that it would then take an additional six to eight weeks before its products are available.

The FDA has also announced a series of measures designed to increase supply. On Monday, the agency said it would implement processes to make it easier for foreign baby formula manufacturers to sell their products in the US. Currently the US produces about 98% of formula domestically.

The FDA will also, on a case-by-case basis, ease some of the requirements it puts on formula companies, for example around labeling.

Some are calling for federal action to tackle the monopoly a handful of companies have on the formula market. Booker, Warren and other senators call for immediate antitrust review in their letter to Vilsack, writing: “This is yet another example of how alarming levels of consolidation hurt American families and can no longer be ignored”

So let's dive right into it, and allow me to introduce to you a company who may be able to shift some gears. ELSE Nutrition is an Israel-based food and nutrition company, develops innovative clean labeled plant-based food and nutrition that produces all-natural, dairy-free, soy-free, and healthy food and nutrition products for infants, toddlers, children, and adults. With the rise in cases of dairy intolerance in babies, there is a greater demand for organic and clean-labeled infant nutrition products. The company’s products are 100% natural and plant-based, made from almonds, buckwheat, and tapioca. Free of hormones, antibiotics, gluten, and other hazardous ingredients, allowing them to get a first-mover advantage in this market.

Else has become well positioned for leadership in the space. With a growing shortage of baby products and a desperate need for toxic-free products, Else Nutrition (BABY) is reshaping the industry and filling a market gap with its plant-based and heavy-metal-free baby food products.

Following an investigation into possible contamination in Abbott’s baby products, the products were recalled from shelves, and the company closed its largest formula manufacturing plant. According to Datasembly, a data analytics firm, baby formula supply shortages increased to 40% last week from 11% in November 2021, although the FDA claims to be working with American manufacturers to increase output and streamline paperwork to allow more imports. Moreover, recent consumer reports have revealed that 50 well-known infant nutrition products contain high levels of heavy metals, adding to the pressure.

The company is a strong player in the plant-based infant formula and pediatric nutrition markets, with the opportunity for significant investment in innovation. With the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) support, Else’s products can now reach low-income families who can benefit from the cleanest, purest, and most complete nutrition available.

The company recently announced that Amazon would accept Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) purchases of Else Nutrition products, allowing SNAP users to buy food with SNAP benefits in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. 

This step will undoubtedly increase brand awareness and revenue growth for the company, but it will also provide Else Nutrition with a way to address the CURRENT supply shortages. The growing acceptance of the company’s products among parents and government approval indicates that the company is prepared to take over existing manufacturers that remain ignorant of toxic metals in their products.

The use of the cleanest ingredients and the most stringent processing methods to ensure purity has resulted in the company pushing the industry toward safer and better newborn nutrition solutions. ELSE’s commitment to addressing heavy metals issues by developing a safe line of newborn nutrition products earned it the Clean Label Project Purity Award for its Super Cereal for Babies. Else, is the first and only baby cereal product in the United States to receive this award, testing for over 400 impurities, heavy metals, and toxins such as arsenic and lead cadmium.

Bottom line, Else is primed for growth and is highly undervalued. They have made steady progress in the last few months, becoming Amazon’s number one,  best selling baby and infant formula product and winning numerous awards for its clean and safe plant-based baby products. Now the company is emerging as THE one that could solve the shortage of baby food products today."|0.18|0|0|0|['Else', 'Else Nutrition', 'Abbott Laboratories', 'the New York Times', 'Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program', 'Amazon', 'the Center for Nutrition', 'Booker', 'Super Cereal for Babies', 'University of Virginia', 'Duggan', 'Kellam', 'Datasembly', 'the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine']

The current macro environment has seen a bit of flight to safety and increasing credit spreads. So, I've been looking at the leveraged loan &amp; CLO markets and how they have been handling the transition to SOFR from LIBOR. The spread between eurodollar and 3 month SOFR has become significant enough that I'm wondering how well CLO managers are able to account for default risks as margin pressures increase and cash flows drop.

  
Over the last 2 years we've had record issuance of CLOs, mostly on LIBOR terms. New issuance is now all in SOFR. New leveraged loans issued in SOFR terms may have insufficient credit spreads built in, as SOFR itself has no credit component, unlike LIBOR, and previously significant CLO demand suppressed spreads. Additionally, derivatives that could be used for hedging SOFR are still in their infancy and may themselves insufficiently compensate for underappreciated credit risks.  


Looking at S&amp;P's info on CLO constituent ratings [here](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/220502-credit-faq-themes-from-recent-leveraged-finance-investor-conversations-12359218). They model stress with very conservative parameters (150bps and -5% EBITDA margin).  Even under these conservative parameters there's still this:

*""Based on the stress, reported EBITDA cash interest coverage ratio remains relatively resilient across the portfolio. Free cash flow deficits are a more significant concern, rising to about 23% of the portfolio from 14%, under our stress case. As expected, issuers rated 'B-' and lower are most vulnerable to cash flow deficits. In this scenario, good liquidity positions and the absence of near-term refinancing needs will likely provide a buffer to downgrades. However, rating outlook revisions or downgrades will become increasingly likely if cash flow deficits persist. Increased cash flow deficits for 'CCC' category issuers, which account for over 9% of our speculative-grade portfolio, is more concerning because these issuers often have unsustainable capital structures.""*

I'll leave it to smarter people than me to guide this discussion, but I'm expecting a series of ratings downgrades over the next few months, but far too late for investors in CLOs to be made aware of the increasing default risks of constituent loans."|0.81|45|0|45|['CLO', 'SOFR', 'EBITDA', 'CCC']

You have a choice. You can

you cash the bond and receive what the bond is worth, including the interest, or
you give up ownership of the bond and the bond is reissued, or.      
the bonds stops earning interest because it has reached final maturity.

As with most financial data, very few times does anything turn out to be 100% logical or sensical. Any scoring methodology you use will yield some bizarre results. My scoring methodology ended up ranking some small-cap, speculative companies high which is tough to say whether a hidden gem was uncovered or if there was an oversight on the scoring formula. If you're not a small cap investor (I'm not) then skip it and move down the list, or better yet, just put a filter on MarketCap &gt; 5 , so you're only looking at  $5B+ mid-caps and above.

THE TRUE POWER OF THE SPREADSHEET IS THAT ALL OF THE FINANCIAL METRICS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN ONE FILE TO MAKE YOUR OWN CUSTOM SCREENER.

If you want to put extra weight on current dividends then you can square the first term. If you're a value investor and want to make an investment decision this week, then use the Distance from 52W low/high and P/B metric as part of your scoring formula. If you want to give a higher weight to larger MarketCap stocks then multiply with something like (1 + ln(MarketCap)/10).

t3_uvbgzk|1653227771|investing|Risks associated with covered call distribution volatility?|"Hi guys, 

So I’ve been doing my research and a dividend aristocrat covered call ETF is - at least a well designed one - has the best trade offs in my opinion.

When half of the shares are being used to sell out the money call options, you still get upside, while also collecting a nice premium in the now. Total returns is similar and even according to some studies a little better than a normal index growth strategy. All this might I add for a less volatility, with one exception:

https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/education/research_publications/HewittEnnisKnupp-BXM-(2012).pdf

If you go to exhibit 13, during the 2008 crash at the bottom distributions from premiums got cut by 20%, and this is an at the money covered call strategy, so I would think the cut is worse for an out the money one(?)

(Which is weird as people told me covered call strategies perform better during downturns. I guess they mean total returns, however this doesn’t account for distribution volatility in such an environment I would think)

Meaning if you expected to collect a stable income every month from this ETF, one risk could be that your monthly distribution randomly gets slaughtered by getting a 30% cut right?

If so, are there ETFs that use an OTM covered call strategy, PLUS some mild use of protective puts to hedge against such events? If so, which ones? (I know you can do this without an ETF but it’s far more streamlined)

You can get far less volatility with similar returns:

https://www.cboe.com/us/indices/dashboard/cll/

Thoughts?

Thanks.

Also, I don’t care to hear about the dividend irrelevancy argument. Share prices are far more volatile than dividend distributions from the aristocrats. Thus, sequence risk is far more of an issue if you relied on a growth strategy, as opposed to a dividend growth one if you consider how much dividends account for total returns for the s and p 500 currently. With the former you likely can draw just from dividends to finance your retirement during a downturn without touching your share principal. With the latter, the same cannot be said as it’s unlikely given how low your distributions from dividends would be (you would need like 10mill to just draw from dividends at 2% lol) Where I’m at now is questioning whether covered calls is a better bargain that a normal aristocrat strategy.

Edit: not all the distributions come from premiums, so the 30% cut would not be come on the whole of the distribution just a portion. Total cut might be something like 15%, not as crazy as I initially thought. That’s 15% cut in the *worst* case scenario btw."|0.73|11|0|11|['OTM']

t3_uued7d|1653102655|investing|My Complete List of Stocks and Their Rankings By Sector/Industry|"This is a repost that now includes the full list of stocks that can be viewed/downloaded from GoogleSheets.

As an investment professional and dividend-growth investor, I'm always looking for better ways to evaluate the investment quality of a stock individually as well as part of my broader portfolio. In the very beginning I used to heavily invest in stocks that were Dividend Aristocrats. But I started asking questions such as, how are these stocks performing compared to their peers. Are there stocks with better performing ROEs? What level of risk (Sharpe ratio) was taken to achieve those earnings? What is the forecasted earnings growth over the next 5 years? How many consecutive years have they increased dividends? What's their payout ratio? What are analysts thinking? Are there sectors/industries I'm overinvested or underinvested in?

So I decided to write some programs to pull free financial data from multiple sources, such as Yahoo Finance!, YCharts, Finviz, Vanguard, Wikipedia, and other sources. I consolidate all of these different data sources, cleanse and standardize the data, and came up with my own scoring metric on how to rank each stock. The metrics I use for calculating my score include metrics such as Current Dividend Yield, 5-yr Forecasted Earnings Growth, ROE, Payout Ratio, Sharpe Ratio, Dividend List Membership (Aristocrats, Champions, Kings, etc.) and it heavily favors stocks with strong histories of paying quality dividends. I try not to give any one metric too much weight.

Pasted below is a link to a GoogleSheets spreadsheet that has the entire list.

What are your thoughts on my top rankings? Any surprises? Any questions on any particular metric? Hopefully it has provided you with extra investment insight. I'm always looking for ways to refine my methodology and scoring, so any suggestions would be appreciated.

Data Disclaimer: Data from free, publicly available sources are known to have data inaccuracy issues and financial metrics/forecasts are constantly changing everyday, so please independently verify any metric you use when making investment decisions. The analysis is for information purposes only and is not to be interpreted as an investment recommendation.

INVESTMENT\_SCORE NOTE:

 I just want to say that my scoring methodology (as with most) has many imperfections and you should not put too much faith into it. As with most financial data, very few times does anything turn out to be 100% logical or sensical. Any scoring methodology you use will yield some bizarre results. My scoring methodology ended up ranking some small-cap, speculative companies high which is tough to say whether a hidden gem was uncovered or if there was an oversight on the scoring formula. If you're not a small cap investor (I'm not) then skip it and move down the list, or better yet, just put a filter on MarketCap &gt; 5 , so you're only looking at $5B+ mid-caps and above.

THE TRUE POWER OF THE SPREADSHEET IS THAT ALL OF THE FINANCIAL METRICS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN ONE FILE TO MAKE YOUR OWN CUSTOM SCREENER.

I encourage everyone who downloaded the spreadsheet to have a little fun and create your own custom scoring metric. It's not hard to do and I'll help you get started.

Let's say, Div Yield, 5yr Earnings Growth, and ROE are important to you then set your Excel formula like this as a starting point: SCORE = (1 + Div%) \* (1+5yrEPS) \* (1 + ROE).

If you want to put extra weight on current dividends then you can square the first term. If you're a value investor and want to make an investment decision this week, then use the Distance from 52W low/high and P/B metric as part of your scoring formula. If you want to give a higher weight to larger MarketCap stocks then multiply with something like (1 + ln(MarketCap)/10).

As a financial data modeler, I'd be interested to hear about your Scoring Formula and would encourage you to share it with us, but also please state your motivation behind the scoring formula, such as, Dividend-Growth, Value-Buy, Short-Sell, etc."|0.88|373|0|373|['ROE', '5yr Earnings Growth', 'financial data', 'Short-Sell', 'Forecasted Earnings Growth', 'Yahoo Finance', 'YCharts', 'Dividend-Growth', 'Vanguard', 'MarketCap &gt', 'Value-Buy', 'Sector', 'MarketCap', 'Wikipedia', 'GoogleSheets']

t3_uu6rsr|1653077991|investing|Testing a theory -trading volume and bear markets|"My step-dad was obsessed with trading / investing. Spent decades studying the markets at a deep level, and I remember him telling me that what characterized a long-term, secular bear market was the following:

1. A steady march down in equity prices with low trading volumes
2. Waning volatility (VIX) as the market moves into this secular bear term

I think the idea was that markets which feature huge swings in the index with high VIX and lots of volume are not indicative of a secular bear, but more characteristic of a cyclical bear within a bull market, or a temporary distortion (think 1987)

In long-term, secular bears, like in 1973 - 1980, buyers / traders just ""go away"". Money stays on the sidelines, and you have a staircase into oblivion, vs. a big slide

t3_utw19n|1653053580|investing|We might be closer to the bottom than we might think|"Over the past few months I’ve been watching stocks fall and monitoring them just as everyone else. I tried to keep a large diversified portfolio and like most of the people my portfolio has been down like everyone else. Except that I’ve noticed that most of my positions are more down YTD than most of the global indexes like sp500 or DJIA. So I kept going over and over the companies and comparing their YTD to sp500 and almost all of them are down way more than the spy. 

Before I go on any further, I work in commodities so I don’t ever directly invest into commodities companies simply because I’m aware of the potential risks and volatility and I guess it makes it seem like a very tough position to trade due to high sensitivity of volatile markets.

In any case, I wanted to get to the bottom of this seemingly disconnect between the average fall of most of the companies and the overall stock market. It was especially weird because the largest heavyweights are your apples amazons and facebooks. So I looked at the performance of [each individual component of SP500 on a YTD basis](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance). I knew that the oil and agricultural stocks have done well this year but the extent has been baffling. Going through the list I got spot 26 (25 actually due to 1st place glitch) before I could find any company that was up YTD that is not agricultural, commodity or oil related. And the pattern sticks. Out of the 127 companies still green YTD I believe about 90% are oil, agricultural or other commodities related companies, with a much higher skew in the top gainers.

So you might ask yourself, so what? We all knew oil and agricultural are doing well this year, what does have to do with the market overall? Well, I keep seeing on a daily basis discussions and charts about how the market is “only” 20% down and if the history is a guide then there’s more pain to come. I mean could be, I’m not claiming to know the future, but what I am trying to say is that very unique market conditions are giving a wrong impression of the market. Unless you’re specifically invested in commodities, most of the companies you own are already down YTD what they would in a typical market crash (eg Amazon down over 40%). A market crash of 30-40% is quite standard and taking away the outlier of commodities we’re right around that mark. Nasdaq is closer to 30% and at this point it’s probably a more fairly accurate representation of the state of the market. Looking back at previous recessions (2007 and 2001) I cannot pick up a pattern of multi-trillion dollar industry enjoying an unprecedented level of success at a time of general pain and bear market I.e. I do not believe that the skewed market conditions are representative of normal market crashes.

t3_utf65p|1653000366|investing|I'm calling Powell's bluff|"In short I predict Jerome Powell and the Fed are talking a tough game on inflation, but will soften later this year leading to a market rally. I also believe we will have a minor recession at worst. Putting this here to refer back to and see if I was on the money.

# 

# &gt; What Will Play Out This Year

The Fed is  jawboning markets down to cool inflation without having to actually jack interest rates up. This is because they can't for an extended period of time. The US government has too much debt to afford large repayments. Furthermore it will become difficult to complete treasury auctions when the fed is selling not buying.

**The Fed doesn't want to kill stocks**, Powell loves the stock market.

In practicality his purpose is to keep debt borrowing costs as low as possible for the US government. This Fed has constantly erred on the side of accommodative, they cut rates in 2019 when there was barely an excuse. They will jump on any excuse to drop rates and print print print. The only time they cannot is when inflation is so out of control it's pissing people off. They're not different people now, they just are talking different.

**Powell faces 4 dragons right now:**

1. Post-covid supply bottlenecks,
2. Elevated food/energy from Ukraine war
3. Supply bottlenecks from China lockdown
4. The inflationary echoes of the covid printing bender and stimulus

Notice something?

All 4 of those will resolve by themselves at some point. While we're not going to wind back the past inflation, we are on trajectory for it to come down. Last month on month reading was .3% or 3.7% annualized. Considering current events not bad. Many leading indicators I use are rolling over.

Inflation will remain elevated for a couple years because the Fed is half heartedly tightening with negative real yields and minor balance sheet reduction. But in order for inflation to keep going up, prices have to keep going up from their current elevated levels. In the near future the 4 dragons will begin to die and this will only help.

**Therefore later this year I expect a softening from the Fed** after a few good inflation prints. This will cause a rally in stocks, not breaking all time highs but higher then now. It doesn't mean we're going back to the 20/21 era, the fed will not be going crazy like that again for a long time. But it's going to look a lot rosier then now.

This means **depression fears are also overblown**, the problem is valuation like the dot.com crash, not a liquidity crunch like 2008. We still have an extra $5t floating around on the feds balance sheet and negative real rates. Borrowing at 4% while inflation's at 9% is a good deal. We may have a technical recession given difficult short term economic events, but it will be mild and short lived.

# 

# &gt; How To Make Money

**Big money is sitting in cash**, the money isn't gone and the cost of borrowing money is still below inflation - making margin loan expansion likely. This means at the first sign of clear skies later this year we're going to get a big rally as liquidity rushes back in.

As predicted **Hypergrowth is oversold** and there's quality names trading at attractive prices. This is the worst time to buy inflation or recession hedges as they're already overbought. Trade the cascade as sectors collapse one by one, buy what has collapsed, don't sit in what will collapse. Don't overpay.

As outlined in a past update, developed nations have no choice but to devalue their currency through persistently elevated inflation. Emerging markets really don't have our inflation problems for the most part since they didn't print. So **EM is about to have an era of outperformance** in stocks and bonds as it enjoys a greater share of global consumption.

Calculating for inflation, real GDP growth and additional cash on the Fed balance sheet the **fair value for the S&amp;P 500 is around 3800**. Anything below that is a steal considering I doubt we're going to have a major economic collapse.

In bear markets correlations become 1. Meaning everything falls in unison by sector, regardless of which companies are actual stand outs. There's too much going on for accurate pricing. When investors panic every bad event that could happen is more then priced in. I always try and buy on panic. **Incredible mispricing's are being created right now, buy them**.

So in short BUY GROWTH STOCKS. The good ones.

I could not find any good analytics webpage/place to see basic company fundamentals, especially for growth stocks.

In my research I found tons of websites which allow chart analysis, candlesticks, chart voodoo and meme generators ;) but no website where I could compare companies (in same areas) on fundamental data. My specific question would be, is there any website which provides the following analysis and am I the only one looking for such?

\- Compare companies (of same area) on multiples, PE, forward PE, margin, revenue, rule of 40

\- Simulation for future development. E.g. one can insert expectation on revenue and ops margin grow and see how if a company is over or undervalued for a horizon of multiple years (of course based on personal growth expectations)

\- Calculate NPV based on future expected interest rate, company growth and multiples.

\- Track record of earning reports of those companies, ideally cleaned up from one-time effects such as M&amp;A activities, SEC fillings

I was reading about the collapse of the stablecoin TerraUSD a few days ago, and there was a description of how it happened that really puzzles me. This question actually goes beyond crypto because I've had it on my mind at other times when reading about stocks. But in this case, it was a particularly strong example for my question, as follows. 

I was reading this transcript of a WSJ podcast (I don't think it's paywalled but I can't be sure because I have a WSJ subscription anyway):

[https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/tech-news-briefing/why-bitcoin-terrausd-and-other-cryptos-are-plunging/ea776e1d-3578-41e3-bbec-950ebb337613?mod=djem10point](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/tech-news-briefing/why-bitcoin-terrausd-and-other-cryptos-are-plunging/ea776e1d-3578-41e3-bbec-950ebb337613?mod=djem10point)

Here's the standout part:

&gt;Because all of that was being sold at once, it at least spooked people,  whether that be institutions or individual traders. And so from those  massive withdrawals, which already kind of put the peg under pressure,  you then had more and more selling from people who got nervous. And so  it created this cascade where all of a sudden everyone was selling  TerraUSD and there wasn't a lot of buying or stabilization that could  happen.  

So, my question is, why does this reporter make it sound like the number of sales and the number of buys is not equal? She's talking about how ""everyone was selling"" and ""there wasn't a lot of buying."" But when an asset is sold, where does it go? Isn't it only possible to sell an asset if another investor buys it? So, every time an asset is sold X number of times, it is also bought X number of times by other people, right? I can see how the *perception of an asset's value can shift*, which would result in the bid/ask prices dropping, and thus the price dropping. But isn't it **technically** incorrect to say that ""everyone was selling""? I think that the only way the # of buys/sales could be unequal at any time is if there was an external repository for assets like in the board game Monopoly. In the game, there's a ""bank"", and players can buy or sell back property (houses) independently of the other players, and the assets just sit there if no one wants them. 

I see somewhat similar terms used about stock markets too, like ""investors are fleeing growth stocks"" or ""investors are rotating out of growth stocks"". But it always looks strange to me when I read that because for every investor ""fleeing"" or ""rotating out"" of a growth stock, there's some other investor buying it or ""rotating into"" it. Otherwise it wouldn't be possible to ""flee"" it if someone else didn't buy it off you. Right? 

I just want to verify: is my understanding correct? These are just expressions that are used even though we understand they're technically wrong? Or am I misunderstanding something? 

I don't really see people using this language about the housing market. Everyone seems to understand that an individual home's value changes based on the perceived (appraised) value even when there's no selling/buying actually taking place."|0.9|34|0|34|['https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/tech-news-briefing/why-bitcoin-terrausd-and-other-cryptos-are-plunging/ea776e1d-3578-41e3-bbec-950ebb337613?mod=djem10point](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/tech-news-briefing/why-bitcoin-terrausd-and-other-cryptos-are-plunging/ea776e1d-3578-41e3-bbec-950ebb337613?mod=djem10point', 'Monopoly', 'WSJ']

t3_urzpxk|1652831255|investing|A Beginner's Guide to Mining|" Tl;dr at bottom.

Mining, like most of its commodities brethren, can be a daunting industry to understand. Filled with its own jargon, development stages, and technical reports, it’s understandable that the generalist investor may have a difficult time entering the space in a more significant way than picking a major and sitting tight. Maybe we can, at least partially, clear the waters.

**Majors, Mid-Tiers, and Juniors**

A relatively simple term, these classifications define the size and development stage of the mining company. 

Majors are large, multinational ventures with numerous producing mines across a wide array of minerals. These are multi-billion dollar (at least) enterprises, and include names like BHP Group, Glencore, Vale, Rio Tinto, AngloAmerican, Jiangxi, and Zijin are all considered majors. New discoveries tend to have minimal impact on stock price, as the size and diversification of these companies doesn’t lead to new production having earth-shattering impact. While each company does have its own unique developments, the majority of an investment in a major is a bet on the spot price of metals. That is, they tend to move in tandem, and will rise during high spot prices, and fall during low. Generalists are usually best suited to majors, as they tend to be stable and distribute proceeds from operations as dividends.

Mid-Tiers are catch-all for producing companies with one or a few mines, but who lack the overall size to be a major. They may focus on one primary metal (gold, copper, etc) or may be a broad strokes company simply lacking the size to become a major. Ivanhoe, Turquoise Hill, and Champion Iron are all companies I would consider Mid-Tier. These companies typically don’t pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest profits to add new properties or expand their mines, but it’s not unheard of (Lundin Mining comes to mind). Investors with a better understanding of the mining industry may target Mid-Tiers as a way to capture the relative safety of a producing mine, with the upside of further growth.

Juniors make up the majority of mining companies, and are where the serious money is made (and lost). These are early stage exploration companies targeting one or two specific properties. There is a long cycle before juniors become producing mines, but they are companies that range from early-stage, just digging holes in the ground hoping to find something interesting, to those that have found a deposit, and are in the process of determining the precise size and quality of the ore. These companies typically have market caps under $500M USD and rely on fundraising to finance their continued exploration. Thus they can be assumed to be on a ticking clock, to find adequate resources to encourage further funding, in a similar way that upstart tech companies continue development to secure subsequent rounds of venture capital funding. They often trade for pennies a share, as financing is usually done through stock dilution and warrants. The Toronto Stock Exchange houses hundreds of juniors, and is your go-to exchange to locate upstart miners.

**Lassonde Curve**

The Lassonde curve is worth a brief mention, and describes the life of a company from initial foundation, through exploration, and ultimately into production. The curve is an elongated, upwards sloping “S” curve. At initial foundation, the company trades cheaply, with only the early founders and seed capital invested. As exploration begins, speculators start to enter the company. Eventually, the company finds a minable deposit, which results in a significant spike in share price, as second wave investors pile in on the good news. At the height of this spike, initial speculators take profit. This selling, followed by the often multi-year period of drilling, permitting, and building a mine leads to a decline in share price, often called the “orphan period.” Building mines are expensive and time consuming. Eventually (assuming it’s a quality project, and competent management), a mine will get built, production will begin, and the price will resume its upward trend, with general investors entering the company.

Note that money can be made at any point in the cycle, assuming the investor is comfortable with the risk involved. Pre-exploratory speculation is the most risky, but offers the highest potential returns. Investing following a good discovery mitigates some of that risk, but still carries a the potential that a mine won’t be built, either due to poor grade, lack of financing, or any number of other reasons. Still, returns at this stage can be substantial. Investing in up-and-running mines offer the least upside, but largely eliminate the risk of the company failing to deliver. Understanding both your own risk tolerance, as well as the point in the curve a company is currently at, can have a major impact on your investment style.

**Terminology and Process**

Company XYZ reports drill intercept of 49 meters 2.3 g/t gold, including 3.5 meters at 5.4 g/t. Is that good? The industry language is the highest barrier to entry in the mining space. There’s not much in the way of “drill reports 101” for new investors to learn.

It’s firstly important to make note of the type of drilling being done. Most commonly you’ll hear diamond drilling, but there are several ways to take samples, ranging from chip sampling to reverse circulation. For the purposes of keeping it simple, we won’t go into all of the differences, but suffice by saying diamond drilling is the most comprehensive, and is most used in feasibility studies, where a deposit has been more or less confirmed, and now the company is exploring the exact grade and size. If you’ve ever looked at drill sampling pictures, and have seen those long, cylindrical cores of rock, that’s done by diamond drilling. A long core is pulled out of the ground, split, and sent to labs to determine the grade of the ore within.

The strike is the next important term to take note of. Simply, this is the point at which mineralization has been found. A vertical strike of 12m would mean the drill went 12 meters deep before hitting ore. Conversely, a horizontal strike tells how long the ore body runs for in a direction.

Intercept is one of the most common terms you’ll read in your drill reports. The intercept is the length of a core sample in which ore mineralization is found. It should be noted that across an entire drill project, this is reported as a single aggregate of all core samples. So when a company reports 100m of 0.8% copper, they’re not pulling out one single core the length of a football field (yes I know yards and meters aren’t 1:1, bear with me), but rather compiling samples from a dozen drill samples. This helps investors know the scope of the deposit as spread across a potential mining pit. Additionally, within this, they may add a phrase such as “including 5m at 2.3% Cu.” So, in this case, the company has 100m of samples that contain an average of 0.8% copper, but within that, they have a particularly rich area 5m long at a higher 2.3% grade.

The intercept is frequently phrased as width. A report stating the deposit is 2m wide can be interpreted in the same way. Pay particular attention to companies who use “width” and “true width.” Drill samples, and deposits, are not always straight up and down. Imagine a deposit of ore in an ovular shape underground, wider than it is tall. To bring back a little geometry, it would make sense that a core drilled straight up and down would have less width than one drilled at an angle, which would pass through more of the ore body. I would never go so far as to accuse a miner of bad faith practices, but an angled drill in this situation misrepresents the size of the deposit. A good mining company will adjust these figures to true width (as more information comes in on the size and shape of the deposit, requiring multiple drill holes), to more accurately define the deposit size.

As a project matures, and more samples are drilled, the company will begin to make estimates of the total deposit. The project will begin to list 3 different grades and sizes, each for proven, probable, and inferred. There is no exact percentage of certainty, but in general, proven reserves are those that the company can expect from the mine with 90% certainty. Probable would include 75% certainty, and inferred is more speculative, at 25-50%. More drill samples can paint a clearer picture of the deposit, and help move inferred projections to probable, and probable to proven.

With this in mind, the company will need to undergo drill projects for both infill and step-out. Infill drilling takes more samples within the already established deposit, in order to help provide more data on its quality. Step-out, then, will drill towards the edge of the known deposit, to determine how much further it continues. It’s crucial for an investor to differentiate the two. A company reporting a high quality intercept within an already known deposit is great, but likely won’t move the needle much, as we already knew there was ore here, this just helps to define the overall grade. A high quality drill program during step-out, however, can have a major impact, as it extends the total size of the potential mine.

While the picture of a deposit slowly comes into focus, the company may begin using terms like open on all sides, open in two directions, or open at depth. Open, in this case, simply means that the edge of the deposit has not yet been determined. A company may have, through step-out drilling, discovered the edge of the deposit to the north and south, but not yet east or west. The project, then, would be open in two directions. Open at depth states that as the company drills deeper into the ground, they have not yet found how far down the deposit goes before ending.

A quick note while depth is fresh on the mind: there are two different types of mines (there’s more, but for our purpose, we’ll stop at two). Open-pit, and underground. Open-pit mines are the ones you see that are large holes in the ground. The company simply starts at surface level, and blasts and digs its way deeper into the ground. Underground mines are exactly as described, tunnels beneath surface level that leaves the topography relatively undisturbed, with mining taking place below. Open-pit is generally cheaper and preferred when the deposit rests between surface level and 200m deep. Further down, moving that amount of earth becomes cost prohibitive, and underground mining becomes more viable. An open-pit where the depth is less than 100m, then, becomes ideal, shallow enough to get to without having to move excess earth. Both can be profitable, but it’s something worth noting.

**Pre Feasibility, Feasibility Reports**

A junior miner identifies and acquires a property they believe to contain minerals. Initial chip sampling and rudimentary drilling come back with positive results. Eventually, the company decides to undergo a more comprehensive drill program to determine the size and grade. Knowing how to read these drill reports is great, but ultimately meaningless without the context of what that means in terms of ultimate viability of a mine. There are precise steps the company will take on its slow march towards ultimately building (or not building) a mine.

Assuming the project returns positive results, the company will commence its pre-feasibility report. Think of this as a rough draft. This is the very first wave of drilling, looking at the initial grades of ore, and coming up with a preliminary estimate of what the deposit may contain. Calling back to our proven, probable, and inferred classifications of reserves, the company is still primarily in the inferred and probable stage. They’re just looking to get a general idea of what’s underground, to determine if it’s even worth pursuing a more timely (and expensive) drilling program. They may also take a look at the surrounding infrastructure. Are there nearby roads or railways, power lines, and water supply? All this needs to be built out for a mine to function. The best reserves in the world mean little if it’s at the top of a mountain surrounded by no infrastructure. Feasibility studies, drill programs, and permitting can cost millions, if not tens of millions of dollars, and take upward of a decade in some cases. And that’s before the mine is even built. The pre-feasibility is the first hurdle in deciding if a company wishes to continue pursuing this project, or cut losses and move on.

Feasibility reports, then, are just more polished and refined versions of the former. Much more extensive drilling is conducted to move those inferred reserves into proven, which justifies the construction of a mine. The company will offer detailed information regarding the construction of power, roads, water, the machinery to be used, and all other expenses that go into a mine. Barracks for employees need to be built, crushers and refineries to be processed either need to be purchased and built, or enough infrastructure such that the mined results can be transported to one should be considered. The company may release a sustaining cost, or all-in-sustaining-cost (AISC). This represents the total cost of all of these expenses, including salaries, government kickbacks, and CapEx, that a company will incur over the life of mine. This is usually compared to the primary metal being mined, in the size that metal is typically valued at. For a copper mine then, this number may look like $2.50 per pound of copper. For gold (which exists in lower quantities), it may be something like $1300 per ounce of gold. 

Companies can use whatever price they want for the metal being used, but prudent financials would warrant taking current spot price, and discounting a certain percent, somewhere around 7.5% usually. From there, they will assign a cut-off grade, that being the lowest grade of ore they can mine and still be economically viable. Of course, as spot price changes over the years, this can fluctuate. Often in a producing mine, the company will issue guidance advising that they’re intentionally mining at lower grade sections of the mine during years where spot price is more lucrative, saving better grades for less profitable years so the mine can remain operational. Lastly, a report should include an estimated life of mine, wherein they project how long the mine will remain in operation given the overall size of the mine, and the number of tons they can process in a given year (sometimes reported as tons per day, or TPD).

**Grades**

Both size and grade play an important role in the viability of a mine. A company reports X million ounces of gold at their property. Immediately, investors may be drawn to the basic math. That million, multiplied by the spot price, this company has billions of dollars worth of gold! And they’re only valued at $200m! Obviously we know that the costs of equipment, salary, and infrastructure play a large part in lowering the value of a mine. Things like tailings dams and the cost to close a mine must be accounted for and budgeted into the entire life of mine. Every mine will be different (hence the AISC)! The cost for a mine in Arizona, nearby to a highway and rail system will be vastly cheaper than atop a mountain in Peru far away from anything. Spot price also plays a huge factor. Higher rates make even low grade mines economical, and vice versa. The following estimates are just that, estimates.

Typically, grades above 0.3% copper can be economical for open pit mining. Above 1% is considered high grade and a great find (I am, at time of writing this, following a company reporting 4% copper grades, but at a 2% cutoff because they’re in the mountains with a ton of expenses. Again, these are just rough guidelines). Currently the global average of all copper discoveries is around 0.5%. Underground mining is more expensive, but can target singular high concentration veins. 5% is a great concentration, particularly considering that copper is typically found alongside gold, silver, and nickel to help boost overall returns.

Gold is usually reported in grams per ton. Over 1 g/t would be good, over 2 would be high grade for open-pit. For underground, 30 g/t would be high grade, but 4-5 g/t could be economical. Silver operates in a similar way, being tied to gold in pricing. 60 g/t would be the cutoff for most open-pit silver mines.

Diamonds, platinum, and uranium are all niche markets, and likely not worth going into for an intro paper. Diamond mines are typically very small, platinum exists in thin veins, and uranium has a host of expenses and regulations that change too much region to region. These can still be great investments, but are a bit more specialized. Likewise, zinc and nickel are typically secondary minerals found along copper or gold. Iron, lithium, and cobalt are other common mining targets, and again, have their own high and low grade requirements.

**Mine Tiers**

A very high grade of ore across a small area can be profitable, but not a particularly great mine. A high total amount of reserves, spread very thinly across a large area may not be profitable at all. Deposits are broken down into 4 tiers. These aren’t necessarily listed on any mining company’s website, but should be noted. This is the difference between the next 100x return, and a property that sits undeveloped for decades.

A note: when we calculate these values, we use long-term commodity prices. Recently (spring 2022) have taken off to the upside. This is, of course, great for miners. But for determining the quality of a mine that will be in operation for 20 or 30 years, we need to be more conservative, and use the average price over a longer time frame.

Tier 1 deposits are rare. If someone claims a particular mine is tier 1, 99% of the time, it’s not. It should bring in at least $300m in revenue per year, AND be in the bottom 25% of sustaining cost for all mines, AND have a life over 20 years. These mines can make a company overnight. Ivanhoe is a perfect example of a junior miner exploding onto the scene with a generational, tier 1 copper find.

Tier 2 deposits are significant finds, but still uncommon. They have similar qualities to a tier 1 mine, but are missing one of the requirements. Perhaps it’s a high grade deposit and long lasting, but the cost to build and sustain is high. Or it’s high grade and cheap, but small, with a 10 year lifespan.

Tier 3 are the most common deposits. They’re small, or low grade, or have other structural issues that prevent them from being a strong mine. These can be economical at higher spot prices, but could be shuttered if prices fall.

Tier 4 deposits are uneconomical. The cost to run the mine will outweigh any value from the resources, even in good markets. These projects will not be developed, unless further exploration finds previously undiscovered deposits, or spot price were to rise significantly.

**Jurisdiction**

While grades, deposit sizes, and even infrastructure are all important things to note, jurisdiction can make or break any project, regardless of how it looks on paper. With deposits spanning the globe, different countries understandably have different policies on how they treat miners. Some nations are more friendly than others. Some are difficult to work with, but ultimately worth the hassle, and others are best avoided altogether.

Geopolitical risk can change year over year. A major shift in political leaning can have major impacts on the viability of a region. So any list today may not be 100% valid tomorrow. But in general, certain nations have historically been more friendly than others. Canada, Australia, and the US are all fairly easy to work with. For these countries, viability can vary state-to-state (or province-to-province). In the US for example Nevada and Arizona are some of the better regions, but California falls fairly low on the overall global list. In South America, Colombia, Chile, and Ecuador are all fairly miner friendly. Further north, Mexico traditionally ranks as a quality region. Argentina, Venezuela, and Peru, on the other hand, can pose difficulties. Africa, driven unfortunately by political instability in several prominent regions, tend to rank low across the board, with Morocco being an exception standing out as a good region.

Jurisdictional risk comes in many forms, and even low ranking nations can still be viable, given the investor understands the risks and discounts appropriately. The Kamoa-Kakula mine in the DRC is one of the best copper finds of the past generation, but the nation has taken 20% control of the project, with further mandates for community investment, and locals in the management chain. That’s not wholly unreasonable, but investors of Ivanhoe or Zijin should be aware of the dilution. Turquoise Hill in Mongolia strikes me as another difficult region. The mine itself is of extremely high grade, but the local government has increasingly taken more and more control of the project. 

In addition to claim a percent of the mine, nations may have unfavorable tax laws or a royalty stream on mined resources. They may demand specific quotas of the local population in management. If a power grid needs to be built, they may require investment such that the surrounding areas can be developed. War, child labor concerns, and corruption also play a factor in the attractiveness of a particular country. Numerous sites publish annual rankings of jurisdiction friendliness, so keep this in mind when exploring a new project.

**Putting it all together**

Ultimately, this is a pretty cursory overview. There’s a lot that got left out. Metals traders dedicate entire careers to this industry. Commodities are quirky, and it’s a long, difficult process combing through a 200 page feasibility report on one single project. But the industry can be rewarding, as well. Metals prices have exploded in recent years. Soaring demand for copper, nickel, and lithium, paired with historic lows for new deposit discoveries are leading to a lucrative opportunity to enter the space. Dated infrastructure has led to huge fluctuations in iron price. Carbon mandates exacerbate this even more.

Majors historically return significant value to shareholders by way of dividends. New companies and new discoveries will soar to the forefront of the mining sector over the next decade, bringing with them their own sizable growth, and ultimately, shareholder value. For generalists looking to enter the space, hopefully this helps to at least partially clear up industry specifics.

# Core Business

Google’s operations are divided in three categories: Google Services, Google Cloud and so called “Other Bets” consisting of several ventures including A.I., robotics, autonomous driving and pharmacy. As Google Services and Google Cloud generate &gt;99% of Google’s revenue I won’t go into much detail on the “Other Bets” Category.

## Relevant Acquisitions

Through it’s acquisition activity google amassed around 250 acquisitions, expanding their research capabilities in fields like A.I., quantum computing and robotics. Below the most important ones are summarized.

**Youtube**

The most famous one of all Google acquisitions. Purchased in 2006 for 1.65 billion dollars Youtube has risen to world wide success and an unchallenged standing almost as relevant as it’s parent company. With revenues as high as 28,8 billion dollars (2021), it generates over 10% of Google’s revenue. It has proven to further expand their earnings-power besides ads with it’s Youtube Premium and Music subscription, which according to Alphabet was the major contributer to an increase of $6.3 billion in Google’s “Other Revenues” (1).

**DoubleClick**

DoubleClick was an ad service provider, who worked with advertising agencies and served major brands like Coca-Cola, GM and Microsoft. After it’s acquisition in 2008 for $3.1 billion lots of customer relations and technology was integrated into Googles ad business. In 2018 Google announced it’s plan to rebrand all ad platforms and merged DoubleClick with Googles own ad platform into the new Google Marketing Platform (2).

**Motorola Mobility**

When Google acquired Motorola in 2011, the company was struggling to gain a foothold in the smartphone business and reported the fifth straight quarter of losses. The company cost $12.5 billion dollar, Google’s largest acquisition, and was motivated as a strategic move to increase Google’s patent ownership and defend the Android operating system. After closing the deal Google sold parts of the business to Arris Group for $2.35 billion and led the smartphone division to success through a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones. In 2014 Google sold Motorola for $2.91 billion, while keeping a major part of the patents. (3)

**Mandiant**

Google announced that Mandiant would be acquired in March 2022, to get integrated into the Google Cloud division.

**Fitbit**

Fitbit, a producer of wearable technology was acquired by Google in January 2021 and integrated into it’s hardware division.

**Nest Labs**

To expand it’s home automation business Google acquired Nest labs in 2014 for §3.2 billion and merged it with the Google Home brand in 2018 to create Google Nest.

## Industry Enviroment / Competition

**Advertising**

Through it’s search engine and Youtube, Google generates significant revenue with advertisment campaigns for it’s customers. It is unchallenged with a market share of 92% for it’s search engine and Google Chrome leading the browser market with 65% (4). Competition in it’s most relevant business is almost irrelevant for it’s earnings power and market position as most major players (Microsoft with Bing, Yahoo) have failed to attack it.

**Google Cloud**

In the highly competitive cloud computing industry Google competes with giants like Microsoft, Alibaba and Amazon. It isn’t in a leading position, but increased it’s market share from 5% (2017) to 10% (2021) with only AWS and Microsoft Azure above. (5) (6)

## Income Statement

## Revenue Growth

Google’s revenue has increased by an average of 21% annually in the last 10 years. With Growth accelerating in the past 5 years (23,3%), the question should be if similar growth can be expected in the future.

Google’s main business of advertising stands as strong as we have discussed above and with more digitilization and e-commerce growth not slowing down the market for it’s search engine and it’s ads will continue to grow. Growth projections in that business reach from 11% to 15%. (8) (9)

As Google Cloud has gained more market share in the last years and has grown it’s revenue by more than 40% on average, it’s safe to say that it will grow at least as much as the overall cloud computing industry if not more. In a recent market research report a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 16% was forecasted until 2026. We will take that at face value for our worst case scenario and will add to it as in a best case scenario, Google will gain more market share. (10)

In recent history Google was able to decrease different parts of it’s costs effectively, thus increasing profitablility. Cost of revenue is made up of \*\*\*\*traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and other revenue costs. **TAC** consists of payments made to traffic distributors, giving Google the platform and audience to advertise for it’s clients.

Other revenue costs consist of licensing fees for **acquired content** sold on YouTube and Google Play, expenses in it’s **data centers** and costs related to Google’s **hardware business**.

**Composition of cost of revenue (COR) (Table 4)**

|Cost in ($ Mio)/Year|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TAC|32,778|45,566|
|Other COR|51,954|65,373|
|Total COR|84,732|110,939|

With past cost development it’s important to use the studied data to make forecasts into the future regarding revenue, cost and profit development to feed our DCF model. We will look for patterns in which relation costs follow growing revenue. With the following table I will try to point that out.

||2013-2014|2014-2015|2015-2016|2016-2017|2017-2018|2018-2019|2019-2020|2020-2021|Average|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue Growth|18,88%|13,62%|20,38%|22,80%|23,42%|18,30%|12,77%|41,15%|21,42%|
|COR|16,81%|9,63%|24,76%|29,73%|30,64%|20,73%|17,85%|30,93%|22,64%|
|R&amp;D|37,76%|24,92%|13,56%|19,19%|28,84%|21,47%|5,98%|14,47%|20,77%|
|Sales and Market|24,06%|11,27%|15,89%|22,97%|26,68%|13,05%|\-2,81%|27,67%|17,35%|

The cost of revenue has trailed revenue quite close and I expect it to continue to be around 40-43% of all revenue. R&amp;D expenses have risen with revenue but have slown down in recent years. It’s not attached to revenue growth directly, but we will assume a small average growth of 10% for the upcoming years as the R&amp;D expenses are already high enough to guarantee Google to be a potential player in all upcoming high-tech industries. Further reductions in the SGA expenses relative to revenue is possible with revenue outpacing those costs, as it has been seen in the past. Still we will assume it too be just stable to have a more conservative approach.

## Balance Sheet

## Debt Level

Google’s long term debt is almost non-existing with $15 billion. It’s earnings were &gt;$70 billion in 2021 so it’s debt could have been paid off with just 20% of that. The company also hold’s $21 billion in cash, which makes debt for the valuation almost irrelevant.

## Capital Intensity

As Google’s business needs large amounts of land, offices and server infrastructure. Aside from large marketable securities positions, most capital is tied up in purchased land, offices and information technology assets like server farms. The company is determined to expand it’s position in that area, which will result in rising capital expenditures for both new offices and new IT assets. (1)

## Liquidation Value / Tangible Book Value

To calculate the Tangible Book Value I will use the most recent book value and exclude all assets I think are intangible. TBV calculation in $billion:

|Book Value|254,004|
|:-|:-|
|\-Goodwill|\-23,010|
|\-Property and Equipment|\-104,218|
|\-Other non-current assets|\-5,778|
|TBV|120,998|

Note: I didn’t exclude smaller positions as it would make the formular unnecessarilly large with no real effect. It’s also quite reasonable as normally the Property and Equipment of Google of cause could be sold for at least a fraction of the audited value.

Google has a TBV per share of: $120998 million / 673.22 million shares = $179,73 per share

## Cashflow Statement

IT assets generally have a high turnover frequence which results in short depreciating periods (4-5 years). The replacement makes up a large portion of the $24.6 billion of capital expenditures, which are needed for the business operation.

Still Google has great liquidity through it’s short-term marketable securities and it’s large cash reserves.

With almost over $60 billion dollar of free cashflow, Google used most of it ($50 billion) to make stock repurchases. Still the company has only really started to do repurchases in the last 4-5 years and because of it’s high valuation the amount of shares outstanding has only decreased by 5% in 3 years, which is quite a disappointment (11). $15 billion were paid in stock compensation and to account for that we won’t add it back into the DCF-valuation even though it’s a non-cash expense.

## Other

## Insider Trading / Ownership

Insider Trading has no significance for Google as high management only sold insignificant portions of their ownership. (12)

The founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin still have small stakes in the company of around 3% each, even though they slowly continue to sell them off. There is also no insider with a significant stake in the company. (12)

## Risks

* Lower advertising spending by customers
* Google’s value for it’s customers could decline
* Competition disrupting the occupied markets

## DCF Model

Summary of the Assumptions made:

* The revenue of Google Services will increase with the projected growth of the overall market of 11%-15%, which is conservative as parts like Youtube are growing at much higher rates
* Google Cloud’s revenue has increased at an annual growth rate of over 40%. In a worst case scenario it will grow at a CAGR of 16% in line with it’s industry projection, but there is a real possibility of it to accelerate at the current rate until it has gained enough size. Our worst, base and best case projection will still stay conservative at 16%-24$
* As COR is staying volatile around 45% of revenue we will assume it to stay at that level
* R&amp;D will rise around 10% every year unrelated to revenues
* SGA (sales, general, administration) expenses will stay at the current level of 14% relative to revenues and won’t decrease any further
* capital expenses have remained quite stable at around $24 billion dollars. We will still assume an increase of 10% per year as in the most recent 10-Q report the capex has risen by over 40%.
* Depreciation rises at CapEx rate
* 2021 is not an outlier
* Share repurchases will range between 2-5% per year, as those are highly dependent on the share price

We will use a projection of the next 15 years to determine Google’s fair value in 3 scenarios at a **discount rate of 8%**

||Worst Case|Base Case|Best Case|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Google Ads CAGR|11%|13%|15%|
|Google Cloud CAGR|16%|20%|24%|
|COR|45% of total rev|“”|“”|
|R&amp;D CAGR|10%|“”|“”|
|SGA|14% of total rev|“”|""”|
|CapEx and Depreciation|10%|“”|""”|
|Share repurchases|2%|3,5%|5%|
|Fair Value|$1690|$2518|$3805|

I would consider te base case to be highly plausible as past growth has indicated much higher growth rates. Of course it’s up to you to choose your margin of safety, but I will consider to pick up some shares if Google falls below $2000.

First of excuse my grammar and spelling I struggle with dyslexia. 

I am looking for an app that I can easily invest into a stocks and shares ISA. I am self employed and if one week I have a good week I usually invest into crypto. But I want to also invest into a safer bet (ISA).

I don’t want to do large lumps sums at a time like £500 vanguard cap. 
Just £50/100 here and there when I have it spare. I know it’s not the most efficient way, but I find it easier to save like this compared to trying to save £500 up and then put it in. 

I’d like to just do it via a app as that seems the easiest way! I know you shouldn’t look at investments everyday etc etc. which I won’t I’d solely use it to put money in.

t3_urd6nb|1652757280|investing|Is an Investment Account Representative (IAR) worth it for someone who wants to passively invest and can do their own trades?|"My wife and I are 30 something self-employed Millennials who are making good money and want to start solo 401ks. We have Roths but will be above the contribution limit this year for the first time. I've been trading stocks for 7 years, and I've become a Boglehead. I have bought individual stocks in the past but am committed to NOT doing that for the solo 401ks. I know that the most robust analyses show that active managers do not in general beat the market. I know there are certain highly exclusive options for \*real\* big money, like things in private equity or w/e, but for the peasants it should be passive or bust.

That being said, is there any reason to not open a solo 401k by myself with Vanguard, and then just auto-buy VUG and VONG for 30 years? I ask because my wife has a family friend who is a financial advisor, and has been pitching to work for us for a while now. I've talked with this family friend and they seem generally trustworthy with no bad intentions. However, it's not clear to me what value this person would bring in the 21st century, where I can set up automatic deposits from my bank account to Vanguard, and then auto-buy VUG and VONG, all while tracking both my bank and Vanguard account from my phone every day.

I recently spoke with a business partner of this family friend, and got a vibe that just makes me go ""hmm"". When I mentioned I'm probably just looking for passive growth funds, this person talked up having clients that are only down 6 or 7% right now when the market is down 18% or w/e. That doesn't really resonate with me though, since I know drawdowns are just part of investing and there is a tradeoff between risk and returns. I then asked, ""Can I see a 10-year's past performance summary?"" but was told ""yes and no"" and given an unclear explanation. It's my understanding that consensus wisdom is almost all managers don't achieve alpha in excess of their fees. Basic statistics says some will and some won't each year, but that's just randomness and the nature of distributions.

Ultimately I really don't want to pay a 1-2% advisor fee for a portfolio that can't beat the 0.04% expense ratio for VUG and VONG for the next 30 years. 25 years from now when I actually consider retirement and want to generate income from my investments in the foreseeable future, I can try to find an advisor who will generate a more stable portfolio that is hedged to some degree. I don't want to insult this family friend, but I just can't see the value in an IAR right now.

Elon Musk hinted that he could seek to renegotiate the price of his Twitter takeover, saying a deal at a lower price wasn't ""out of the question,"" Bloomberg reported Monday.

The stock has dropped as investors fear Musk will walk back on his agreement to acquire the social media company for $44 billion.

Musk reportedly made the comment while speaking at a summit hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks and David Friedberg for their ""All-In"" podcast.

…

The stock is down more than 7% for the day investors fear Musk will walk back on his agreement to acquire the social media company for $44 billion.

Twitter shares have also erased all gains made since Musk disclosed his investment in the company on April 4, in part thanks to a sell-off late last week. Musk said Friday that the acquisition was ""on hold"" while he researches the proportion of fake and spam accounts on the platform, which he believes Twitter has misstated.

Musk on Monday estimated that fake users make up at least 20% of all users, according to the Bloomberg report. Twitter, meanwhile, has said the accounts made up fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users in the past quarter."|0.91|1364|0|1364|['Chamath Palihapitiya', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/musk-reportedly-says-twitter-deal-at-lower-price-not-out-of-the-question.html', 'Twitter']
t3_ur3uyp|1652729209|investing|Do I have a bad financial advisor?|"I'll preface this by saying I'm not one who pays attention to markets that much. Unless it's national news (like it has been the last few weeks), I barely even think about my investments. But, over the last couple years, I've had this sort of nagging feeling in the back of my head that I am only now for the first time vocalizing: I'm not happy with my financial advisor, but before I bring it up, I want to get a gut check on whether on not I'm being fair.

I won't go through my entire investment allocation, but here's a quick breakdown:

* Wife and I both have company sponsored 401k's which we contribute the max to every year.
* Wife and I also both have ROTH IRA's run by the financial advisor, both of which we contribute the max to every year.
* We have no kids and no debt (besides mortgage), and we have no other market investments. We do, however, have a strong cash emergency fund in savings.

I'm able to look at the rate of return on our advisor-controlled ROTH IRA's by year. If I'm just comparing their rate of return against the S&amp;P 500, here's where it nets out:

&amp;#x200B;

||2018|2019|2020|2021|2022 so far|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Advisor Returns|\-12.67%|14.53%|12.07%|14.14%|\-16.77%|
|[S&amp;P 500 Returns](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns)|\-6.24%|28.88%|16.26%|26.89%|\-15.57%|

Each month, I check all of our balances and log in a spreadsheet. I am consistently ""impressed"" that my Principal Target Retirement 2035 account seems to outperform the advisor accounts. My wife's is a TIAA, and hers seems to do better than the advisor run accounts as well.

What's more -- now, I'm NOT an expert on the markets, but I asked them a few days ago whether or not now would be a good time to make our ROTH IRA 2022 payments (we haven't done that yet), since the markets are down. He was kind of wishy washy, and even implied it may be better to wait until the end of the year to see what our financial situation looks like. They gave a similar response when I asked the same question in March of 2020 when the markets were down. They consistently tell me you can't time the market, and I get that, but... if I'm a financial advisor, am I not doing everything I can to get my clients to invest now? Again, happy to be wrong here.

Here's a redeeming factor that should be taken into consideration. The financial advisor changes us a very low fee -- $2500 yearly for basically anything we ask for. This is apparently the friends and family rate, as my parents are also clients. As I look back on the four years we've been with this advisor, the one time they were really helpful was when we bought our home. They did a great job of walking us through all of the things to look out for, forms, pitfalls, etc as part of their regular services. They also made some great recommendations regarding term life insurance and legal insurance.

So... I'm basically wondering if this is all worth it? I'm less concerned about paying $2500 a year, and more concerned that it seems I could just put everything into something that tracks the S&amp;P 500 and do better on my own. Am I looking at the S&amp;P 500 numbers wrong?

I guess I just thought a financial advisor was someone who made smart investments on your behalf to beat the baseline. Maybe I'm wrong and need some perspective.

You have to sell everything, stocks and bonds, indiscriminately.

It bothers me that I cant grasp a seemingly fundamental thing, which is, that under strong inflation having or making debt is good. So maybe it helps if I tell you quickly my situation:

- My wife and me make around 250k a year, being engineers
- We bought a place for 700k two years ago and still have around 400k in debt to pay

Now our goal was always to pay off the remaining 400k asap, so I have this ballast off my shoulder and we could be done in 6 years max. Then, being debt free I figured I could live more freely, investing the then higher savings (from not paying the mortgage anymore) into whatever. But mostly not being under the pressure of having debt.

I have issues, while understanding the theory, to see the positive in practice. I „feel“ that my grocery bill is now 10% higher than months ago because of inflation . I feel that in my wallet that I have to pay more for the same. That’s negative.

But I don’t „feel“ the positive impact on inflation on having debt. I know(or maybe I don’t) that debt must be worth less under inflation. But I cant recognise this.

I was advised to not pay off the debt asap because of inflation, I just don’t seem to get it. To be fair, as an engineer, economics was not part of my classes.

I‘d appreciate your time to help me. What should I do? Keep the debt longer and make even more debt (in order to do what?

t3_uqg9zy|1652650871|investing|Investing close to maturity bonds|"Hey fellow reddit investors,

The current downturn in the market has brought down valuations of some great companies to reasonable prices, but I think true bargains are still rare. I want to keep some money handy for possible upcoming bargains, since I think we're in for a slow recovery and some more pain in the short term. However, keeping money in times of high inflation guarantees a loss in purchasing power.

Therefore, I've been monitoring some bonds, that will mature soon (6-15 months). The idea is that their prices should not be greatly influenced by market conditions unless the issuer defaults. So I should be able to take out the money if I need it without taking losses. Additionally, if the bonds are currently trading under call prices, together with the coupon I might be able to offset inflation.

I have screened some bonds and noticed that some small and mid cap companies have bonds with tempting yields. The main risk seems to come from defaults which will be more likely in a recession. Therefore, I went ahead and looked at balance sheets, income and cash flow statements of those companies. I found that while some of those companies do look like trash, others seem to be quite solid. The bonds of those were trading above 100% in December, reflecting the low probability of of default. However, they have taken a hit of of 5-10% and thus offer great yields together with the coupons. 
Here is an example:
R-Logitech 21/23 has an 8.5% coupon and trades at 95%. It will come to maturity on March 29th 2023. Logitech doesn't seem to be going out of business until then and able to repay debt eg. debt to equity ratio &lt;1.
Therefore, this would be a 12.5% gain before taxes and should more than offset inflation. Since the duration is only about 0.75 years that's an annual yield of ~16%. 

Am I missing something and should consider something else or is this an other bonds like it save, inflation proof ways to keep money (and even pocket a gain)?"|0.74|17|0|17|['Logitech']

# Qualitative evaluation

Basic Fit is a low cost gym operator in Europe.

It’s the largest operator around, with big growth potential in terms of locations and niche (under-penetrated, low-cost environment).

Its gym operations are moderate, with no special user experience.

Its owner is heavily vested with 15%\~ holds.

Its low prices and the capital intensive space are its moat.

It is at risk in terms of high debt, fluctuations in members and supply chain issues.

With decent conditions, and around 17%\~ owners earnings (after discount), the company will be able to generate (before taxes) almost 2B\~ (accumulated) in 7 years.

More over, after 6 years\~ the company will be able to start reducing its debt.

Gold has an inverse relationship with the USD traditionally. When the value of USD goes up, Gold goes down.

Also Gold is seen as a safe haven in tough times.

t3_up1wxq|1652477369|investing|What the Fed should/could/will do with monetary policy? Let's summarize sentiment.|"Hello FinanceTLDR here again.

By now we should all agree that the Fed is tightening monetary policy. However, there is a lot of disagreement on what the Fed should/could/will do with monetary policy moving forward. And whatever they do end up doing will have huge implications on the overall market.

So today I want to give a quick sampling of all these conflicting opinions to help you make up your own mind about where the Fed is headed.

Let’s start with overall market expectations.

**Overall expectations**

The [Atlanta Fed projects](https://www.atlantafed.org/cenfis/market-probability-tracker) that the market expects a 3% Fed Funds Rate by the end of the year.

**The Fed shouldn’t be raising rates**

Carl Weinberg, High Frequency Economics Chief Economist &amp; Managing Director, went on Bloomberg recently talking about how the current inflation is caused by supply side constraints and not rising demand. This is because of energy prices raising much higher relative to other prices, which is actually deflationary since a lot of money is going into energy prices and less for discretionary consumption.

This creates a growth problem and hammering demand when the supply side is an issue will cause a lot more pain than is necessary. The Fed now should be cutting rates instead to keep investment flowing into alternative energy solutions.

**The Fed can try to raise but won’t get there**

Josh Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and regular CNBC contributor, mentioned in a recent The Compound podcast that he thinks 3% rates (market expectation) by year-end is too high. The Fed will try to raise to that level but something will break in the process and force the Fed to backtrack. This is similar to what happened in 2018 when overnight repo rates blew up forcing the Fed to reverse course and loosen monetary policy again.

**Inflation is a demand side issue, the Fed needs to raise**

Michael Darda, MKM Partners Chief Economist &amp; Macro Strategist, recently went on Bloomberg saying that inflation is actually a demand side issue and the Fed is right in raising rates. His reasoning is that supply side shocks can change the composition of GDP growth but not increase growth, and if we look at how GDP and inflation has overshot the previous trend, it appears demand side is causing about 60-70% of the overshoot. In this case, the Fed is right about raising rates.

Bill Dudley, former NY Fed President, also agrees that this inflation is caused by the demand, but he has a different take. He thinks that inflation is actually largely driven by a tight labor market that is causing real wages to actually fall behind inflation. The Fed therefore needs to cool off the labor market and this will cool off inflation as well. Dudley thinks a 4-5% Fed Funds Rate at year end is more reasonable, and 5-6% rate won’t surprise him.

**Inflation is going to stay elevated. The Fed needs to be more aggressive**

Finally, we have Jeremy Siegel, 

Jeremy Siegel, Professor of Finance at the Wharton School, who recently went on CNBC to say that there is actually a lot of inflation that won’t show up in the CPI index until later (e.g. housing-related inflation) and we’re going to see an elevated CPI index for the next 6 to 9 months. Therefore, the Fed actually needs to be way more aggressive and do a 100 bps hike instead of a 50 bps hike as the next step up.

There’s a lot of conflicting opinions out there on what the Fed should do or will end up doing. Hopefully this is a good enough sampling of some of these opinions and you’ve found it useful in making your own mind up on what the Fed should/could/will do."|0.84|76|0|76|['CNBC', 'NY Fed', 'Macro Strategist', 'Fed', 'Ritholtz Wealth Management', 'Atlanta Fed', 'Compound', 'the Wharton School']

Look at the chart in https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT, you will see that the savings rate is dangerously low from 04-08. Then the bubble popped and nobody is able to spend anymore.

Now looking at what we have now - the savings rate is coming back down from a historically high level but we are still at 6%. This is what the fed referred to as ‘strong household balance sheet’. people still have plenty of money to spare, at least as of now.

So if the fed is not too aggressive after reaching neutral (2%) the savings rate would come down to 4%-5% level for a while, the consumer demand will cool down. If this is the case, we will likely see few quarters of neutral-to-negative GDP growth (so technically a slowdown rather than a full-blown recession, like we have seen in 08, that made millions out of jobs) but no plummeting of GDP, again, because people now have money to spare."|0.72|51|0|51|['fed']

t3_uobsfs|1652391109|investing|Backtested a Volatility Strategy From an Academic Paper, Beat Market by 4x|"Hello r/investing friends, FinanceTLDR here,

I recently backtested a ""volatility managed strategy"" from Alan Moreira and Tyler Muir's 2017 paper [""Volatility Managed Portfolios""](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jofi.12513). My results show that following their methodology for a little over the past decade would have significantly outperformed the market.

Specifically, starting from 2010, the volatility managed strategy saw a total return that was more than four times greater than the buy and hold strategy. Put in other words, $100 invested in said strategy in 2010 would have turned into more than $1700 today, while $100 invested in a buy and hold strategy would have turned into just $480. Even better, this strategy appears to be relatively accessible to a retail trader through the ETFs: SPY, UPRO, &amp; VGSH.

Backtest results: [https://i.imgur.com/kzHv5Av.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/kzHv5Av.jpg)

# TLDR

The general idea behind the strategy is to weave in and out of SPY (ETF for the S&amp;P 500) based on market volatility. If the market is volatile, we stay in safe US government bonds (VGSH, ETF for short term US treasuries), and if the market is calm, we buy into SPY with leverage.

The reason this works is that the US stock market generally goes up, especially in low volatility periods, and low volatility also significantly reduces the cost of leverage.

We can measure market volatility by calculating the recent variance of the price of SPY.

Here’s a high level summary of the process:

* If the variance of SPY is below a certain threshold (low volatility):
   * Invest in SPY with leverage
* If the variance of SPY is above a certain threshold (high volatility):
   * Invest in safe US government bonds

# Diving Just a Bit Deeper

In their paper, Moreira &amp; Muir suggest that over the past \~100 years, investors would have been able to achieve positive alpha in their portfolio by regularly adjusting their equity exposure as realized volatility fluctuates. In low volatility periods, you want to be invested in the S&amp;P 500 and with leverage (low volatility means cheaper and safer leverage) and in high volatility periods, shelter in safe US treasuries.

Our backtest showed that most of the time, using this strategy, you'd be leveraged in S&amp;P 500. This is because volatility in the past decade has been extraordinarily low.

This paper was written in 2017 yet the strategy they put forth worked incredibly well during COVID. The strategy shifted exposure almost entirely into US treasuries at the beginning of the pandemic and remained there until around June before returning to its normal leveraged position which allowed it to take advantage of the bull run that occurred in the back half of that year.

To put this in practice and make it easily accessible for a retail investor, we chose to use the 3 ETFs: SPY, UPRO, and VGSH. For cheap and simple leverage with S&amp;P 500, who use a mix of SPY and UPRO (3x leveraged S&amp;P 500 ETF). However, this also means that you can leverage up to only 3x but this should be enough.

This practical strategy tracked the ideal strategy in the paper pretty closely and only slightly underperformed.

Here’s where I could use some clarification. As I understand it, the market is pricing in expectations of further rate increases in the prices of bonds thus forcing lower interest bonds to sell at a discount (adjusted for credit risk). Thus, if the market is efficient, and (importantly) investor is planning to hold to maturity, one could expect current rates to already be in line with future (higher) rates. 

Still, bond prices are continuing to fall and the current general sentiment seems to be that they are not yet an attractive risk-adjusted investment. Guided by the general understanding that anything that has intrinsic value (once again ignoring credit risk for now) has to be an attractive investment when discounted deeply enough, at what point does that happen to bonds as long as one plans to hold them to maturity.

TOKYO— SoftBank Group Corp. 9984 -8.03% on Thursday reported an enormous $26.2 billion loss on its big portfolio of technology companies in the first three months of the year, as the company took a record annual loss for the second time in three years.

“The world is in a chaotic situation,” said Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, citing Covid-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “In this chaotic world, the approach we at SoftBank should take is defense.”

Stinging the company were soured investments in numerous startups in its $100 billion Vision Fund, the world’s largest private investment fund that was raised five years ago with the intent to seed a generation of new tech giants.

Among the biggest bad bets was Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc., which has faced regulatory pressure in Beijing. As of the end of the latest quarter, the Vision Fund had lost $9.7 billion of the $12.1 billion it invested in Didi, the company said.

There is more pain to come: SoftBank said its holdings in publicly listed Vision Fund companies fell by more than $13 billion since its fiscal year ended March 31.

...

In all, SoftBank said the Vision Fund has made just $3.1 billion on the $45.6 billion it invested in its publicly listed companies as of Wednesday’s stock market close, a slim return after five years in which the Nasdaq has nearly doubled.

He devoted much of the presentation to trying to reassure shareholders concerned about SoftBank’s debt levels, telling them that he is closely managing its debt and cash.

In recent months, the company borrowed nearly $6 billion tied to startup investments in its Vision Fund 2 division—an unusual move for a venture capital fund given the high risks involved—and raised additional money through financial instruments tied to its nearly 25% stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding.

So the fed is raising rates, which has caused the stock market bubble to burst, but barely tame inflation, as to tame inflation yoi have to raise rates above the rate of inflation.


So now we’re in a situation where, if the minimal rate hikes don’t curve inflation, they’ll have to raise them much higher, which will crash the economy. Or the FED will ignore this, and inflation will continue to run hot, causing significant dollar devaluation.

t3_untrr0|1652333386|investing|Supply chain shock will likely get slightly worse before it gets better|"As Shanghai lockdown goes into its end, we would expect supply bottlenecks ease a little bit. But the short term shock is still to be felt. The largest increase in CPI is most likely March as oil jumps. But the largest increase in PPI might still be ahead of us as the shock unravels. 

As an example, major car companies will likely have to halt production for a short period of time after parts run out (before they got replenished). Tesla is experiencing that in Shanghai. Smaller companies might be able to secure some parts but the productivity will likely but adversely affected.

What does this mean for stocks?

1. Earnings will be ugly for companies that are more reliant on just-in-time delivery of parts to conduct normal production. So expect delays for companies that does complicated manufacturing. If they resort to increasing prices, their sales will be down. Not an easy way out for Q2 earnings.

2. PPI will likely get a shock to the upside, leading to more persistent inflation and likely giving fed more reasons to not stop rate hikes. I would say another 50 basis points on top of the scheduled three 50 basis points. Then afterwards few 25s.

3. The market might react adversely to the PPI news, or at least very sensitive to it. Expect soaring VIX before CPI/PPI releases for June and July.

The good news is that, after June and July, mostly at the second half of this year
1. China comes out of the lockdown and begin normal production again, supply chain will likely improve during the later half of the year. Freight costs will go down. Inflation will edge downward as well.
2. Some domestic measures such as  gas tax reduction or tariff reduction, we will see inflation drop as well.

The market will likely react positively to these news as supply eases to meet the demand.

Just to note that another uncertainty comes from the Ukraine crisis. If European countries are all hell bent on getting off Russia oil, their economy will be wrecked. I hope that cooler heads prevail and every stakeholders, Ukraine, Russia, the US, Europe and China can work together to come to a peaceful resolution.

A listing could happen as soon as this year though the timing could slip, said people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The deliberations are ongoing and the company could still remain private, they said.

Instacart is working with banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. on an offering, said the people, who added that other banks may be included later. A representative for Goldman Sachs didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment.

A beneficiary of the coronavirus pandemic, Instacart’s pace of growth has decelerated. It announced in March that it was cutting its valuation about 40% to $24 billion, Bloomberg News reported. The company was previously valued at $39 billion in a March 2021 funding round that included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and D1 Capital Partners, as well as Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.

Instacart’s public debut could come at a turbulent time in the stock market. Only two IPOs of more than $500 million have priced this year in the US. Excluding blank-check firms, 52 companies have raised $4.4 billion this year, compared with 201 listings for a total of more than $71 billion during the same period in 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

t3_unmtwn|1652311132|investing|What the Fed is really trying to fix|"Let’s get right down to it.

We know that the Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates (market expects rate to be at about 3% by year end) and it will trim its almost $9 trillion balance sheet. This balance sheet includes $2.7 trillion in mortgage backed securities (MBS). There are proposals to sell $30 billion in US treasuries and $20 billion in MBS per month.

The official narrative to this massive tightening of fiscal policy this year is to quell inflation. For context, Jan CPI was 7.5%, Feb was 7.9%, March was 8.5%, and today’s print for April came in at 8.3%. These are historically high inflation rates.

But I suspect the Federal Reserve isn’t actually targeting inflation. They are much more worried about something else.

This is why.

Inflation is a function of supply and demand. The Fed with their fiscal policy has decent but also blunt control over demand. It doesn’t have as much control over supply. Especially in this macroenvironment where supply is constricted by a war and pandemic lockdowns halfway across the world. Interest rate hikes and balance sheet runoff will not bring peace to Ukraine, nor will it slow spread of COVID in Shanghai.

In addition, we already see aggregate demand in a really bad spot, with GDP showing a rare 1.4% decline last quarter. Demand is pretty dead. Peloton is down 92.5%. People aren’t in the mood of buying.

So if the demand is already low, and Fed can’t control supply chain issues, how do they fix inflation with interest rate hikes and balance sheet sell off?

Answer is they can’t. CPI inflation is not what they care about.

Rather, the Fed is super worried about the housing market. We already see that the housing market price trends are significantly higher than the past decade’s upwards trend and I reckon the Fed is really worried about any sort of deleveraging in the housing market. Since about 26% of household wealth is tied to mortgages, if we start seeing foreclosures, significant household wealth will just vanish which will be deadly for the US economy.

Although cooling the housing market means pulling back the stock market, it’s a lesser evil since stocks are not usually purchased on leverage, while houses are typically always bought with leverage by majority of US pop.

Interest rate hikes and MBS sell off might not have much impact on inflation in this macroenvironment but they directly pare back home prices, and that’s where we think the Fed is targeting."|0.73|165|0|165|['Fed', 'Peloton', 'MBS', 'the Federal Reserve']

I sort of doubt most people know how they work and I won’t explain the base rate and the inflationary rate combo that produces the yield, I will assume you know how this works and that you did your due diligence before investing in anything.

1)      The historic rate an I bond pays is well below 3% with the exception of older bonds bought with the higher base rates.    Please look at this chart and note that it will vary depending when you bought them as the base rate changes, but, generally, you are looking at the top number in each column for what that bond will pay during the time you buy it.  Most of these numbers are well below 4.  https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/ibondratechart.pdf 

2)      The base rate on these bonds bought now is 0! ZERO!!  That means when inflation is back to 2% these bonds will be paying next to nothing. Like honestly likely &lt;2%.  Look at the chart.  The timeline for inflation to be curbed to normal rates will likely be 1-2 years max, but that is just my speculation.

3)      Bonds are illiquid.  Money in this bond earning 9% now, and likely less than that by 1-2% or more in 6 months will completely miss all the stock rebound that is due to come in the next bull market whenever that may be.  I predict people to scramble dumping I bonds to try to get back into the market as they miss out on 10, 20 30% gains from the recovery bull run.  I bonds will underperform the market long and medium term imo. Period.

4)      The 3 month interest penalty.  I am damn near positive that almost none will leave their bonds to mature for 5 years once that rate is back to &lt;4%.  If you praise an I bond now as gains and leave your money in at 4%, you don’t know what you’re doing.   You will try to get your money out and forfeit 3 months of interest which if you leave your bonds for 1 year cuts your rates effectively by 25%, 12.5% for 2 years and so on.  Not to mention you just missed all the market rebound, or a good chunk thereof.

&gt;The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.3 percent in April on a
seasonally adjusted basis after rising 1.2 percent in March, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.3 percent before
seasonal adjustment.

&gt;Increases in the indexes for shelter, food, airline fares, and new vehicles were the largest
contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index rose 0.9 percent over
the month as the food at home index rose 1.0 percent. The energy index declined in April after
rising in recent months. The index for gasoline fell 6.1 percent over the month, offsetting
increases in the indexes for natural gas and electricity. 

&gt;The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in April following a 0.3-percent
advance in March. Along with indexes for shelter, airline fares, and new vehicles, the indexes
for medical care, recreation, and household furnishings and operations all increased in April.
The indexes for apparel, communication, and used cars and trucks all declined over the month.

&gt;The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending April, a smaller increase
than the 8.5-percent figure for the period ending in March. The all items less food and energy
index rose 6.2 percent over the last 12 months. The energy index rose 30.3 percent over the last
year, and the food index increased 9.4 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period
ending April 1981."|0.97|1019|0|1019|['the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm\n\n&gt;The', 'All Urban Consumers']

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc

Mizuho Financial Group, Inc

Since then though, they've all maintained that 2009 price level, with some relatively minor price increases up and down-- in the end, the prices seem to always level out. [Here's an example with Sumimoto for example.](https://i.imgur.com/6uxTfLi.png)

Common sense tells me that this is because what they offer to investors is a nice dividend. Right now in the 5% range. But prior to the recession, their stock prices were much higher (4-5x higher). Were they offering similar dividend yields at that time? Or was this shift where Japanese financial groups decided to move away from a purely growth-based investing reward system, to more of a dividend based reward system?

Hello all,

I am currently working on a new concept regarding how companies operate and would like to hear your feedback!

Normal companies work as follows, they have a product sell it, and make a profit. This profit can be reinvested to increase the company value or can be used to pay to shareholders in form of dividends.

The value of a stock is determined by the so-called goodwill of a company and the number of products they sell.

What factors out is that a lot of huge companies are just platforms and the real value is about the community around them.

Currently, we are working more towards and data reward growing technique. We have a navigation app that rewards users directly for using our navigation app in form of the MMaps token, it's called MapMetrics: [https://mapmetrics.org/](https://mapmetrics.org/).

The community will be in charge of providing live data with a special position tracker and will be able to send road notifications and edit the maps worldwide. This will create multiple revenue streams.

1. In-app advertisement space: There are ads in the App that local/ global businesses can use to send geolocation driven coupons / adverting to promote their businesses
2. Web Api: The road users will get rewarded for sensing live traffic locations but also will be able to update the map and edit it creating the most up-to-date map that is available. External developers e.g. scooter apps, and bike rental apps, will be able to call this map inside their app and shorten their development time.
3. Data packages: Geolocation-focused data is truly valuable and with the implementation of our SPTs, it’s even more precise. By creating a new in-depth vehicle-specific data package for public and private institutions, policy and business decisions can be implemented more accurately – the in-depth data sets will be a game-changer.

These three revenue streams will be sent back into the MapMetrics token(MMAPS), driving the growth of the platform value of the token and rewarding the community and investors for their effort.

Please let me know what you think, if there are more opportunities concerning the business model and if you have any questions about the project.

Thank you in advance!"|0.25|0|0|0|['App', 'MapMetrics']

&gt;  
&gt;**My point is that wealth is built with debt, full stop.** Whether it's building a business, buying a rental property, a franchise, or equity in an already existing one, the wealthiest people in the world purchase their cash flow assets with other peoples' money. However, before you're wealthy, access to that good debt can be hard to get, and **I wanted to share one avenue that most people have that they might not realize.**

I'm a profitable trader. However, the biggest obstacle to me growing my account has just been lack of capital(I started with my stimmy check and have slowly ground that upwards), and having PDT restrictions. I've been on the hunt lately for a way to expedite things via leverage or margin, but personal loan interest rates are garbage and I don't have home equity to take a line of credit out on. I recently stumbled upon 401k loans(NOT hardship loans) being a thing, and I thought I'd share with everyone how pretty freaking amazing they are(idk how much they differ from 401k to 401k, so please DYOR)

* There's a flat processing fee, mine was $125.
* You can withdraw a minimum of $500 and a maximum of $50k or half your current account balance, whichever is less.
* You choose the repayment period, between 2 weeks and 60 months
* My interest rate was 5.5%, BUT any and all interest you pay goes right back into your 401k account, so I don't really see any downside there.
* Payments are done through your payroll company and are deducted straight from your paycheck. However, if you leave your current employment for any reason, voluntary or otherwise, you're technically on the hook for the rest of the loan amount, otherwise you'll have to take it as a taxable distribution at 10%(don't quote me on that figure).

The only two downsides I saw were shackling myself to my current employment for a couple years(which in all honesty is probably where I'll be anyways) and the necessity to use this money in a way that outperforms the market, which I've done fairly consistently.

Obviously, as with all debt, it can be bad or good depending on how you use it. I was just surprised that I and a bunch of my other friends didn't know this was an option, so I thought I'd share.

""management plans to continue to allocate excess funds equally towards debt repayment and share buybacks until net debt levels have reduced to $12 billion. Then, the company expects to allocate excess funds 75% towards share buybacks and 25% towards debt repayment. Once the company's net debt balance is at its $9 billion floor, the company expects to allocate excess funds fully towards shareholder returns.""

The market becomes move and more leveraged as time goes on until **Oct-21** when [The Fed Says it Could Begin Tapering Process by November](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/federal-reserve-releases-minutes-from-its-september-policy-meeting.html). Markets finally start to deleverage once The FED states that it will [Begin Tapering](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20211103a.htm) in **Nov-21**.

My point in writing this is not about timing the market, but about making people understand the mechanics of what is happening:

&gt;But this is how margin debt and the stock market feed each other: Surging stock prices give people the urge to pile in, and they borrow money to do so, which drives up stock prices even further. But when the rally ends and stocks head south in a significant manner, and when people are highly leveraged, they will unload stocks to pay down their margin debt, and some will be forced to do so, and this drives down stock prices further.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://bit.ly/3L4weVb](https://bit.ly/3L4weVb)

However, the driving factor in all this is Monetary Policy because Margin Rates are usually based on Prime + Percentage. So, as Rates Increase the Margin Rates increase which means people are less likely to Buy on Margin which puts downward pressure on prices, which feeds into the vicious cycle mentioned above. Not only that, but DCF Valuation change once interest rate changes. Meaning, now everyone has to revaluate company fundamentals - and no one knows exactly when interest rates will stop rising or when.

The point is that it doesn't matter how strong the overall macroeconomy is or the company - stocks could still decrease because of market deleveraging. It could be that inflation has peaked, real wages increase, and the overall macroeconomy remains relatively strong. However, it won't matter - even in that situation stocks will continue to decline so long as Rates Increases.

\------------

**TL;DR** \- Monetary Policy and interest rates are more important for stock market Bears vs. Bulls than macroeconomic or company fundamentals when interest rates are *changing*. The only way to properly price a company based on fundamentals is when interest rates are neutral. *Changes* in interest rates create shock events - positive or negative - that change The Market. Until rates become neutral, and The Market fully adjusts to the new equilibrium, there *will* be more pain."|0.87|62|0|62|"['|Nov-20|722,118|', 'Fed', 'Rates Increase', 'FED', 'DCF Valuation', '|Feb-20|545,127|']"

I understand why investors in this demographic might use a dividend strategy in tax-advantage accounts, since any dividends received aren't taxed and can be immediately reinvested, but I don't understand why a younger investor would use this strategy in a taxable account (as I often see posted in /r/dividends). If you have considerable income, pretty much every dividend received will be immediately taxed in one form or another, reducing your overall growth potential.

Wouldn't it make more sense to invest mainly in growth/value stocks and let your investments grow without being continuously taxed? In theory, you would be able to grow your savings and eventual dividend income much quicker by only paying taxes after you have sufficient capital and are ready to sell some/all of your growth/value stocks to transition into a dividend strategy. In addition, you'll pay a lower tax rate than you would with dividends thanks to long-term capital gains.

Am I missing something? Because right now, I don't see any reason to use a dividend stock strategy in my normal brokerage account since the tax drag will considerably slow my accumulation of wealth and I don't plan to rely on dividends as a form of income for at least another decade."|0.69|5|0|5|[]

t3_ulhgmr|1652064284|investing|The Case for Optimism: Time to be greedy when others are fearful|"As of May 6th, the S&amp;P 500 is down \~14% while the Nasdaq is down \~25%. Americans are extremely pessimistic about the economy, with \~75% expecting the economy to worsen. Inflation concerns dominate the list of worries, with CPI in March 2022 coming in at a blistering 8.5%, the highest in 4 decades. The Fed has embarked on what appears to be the first of several 50 bps rate increases to cool inflation, in the hopes of engineering a ""soft landing"". On the geopolitical front, the tragic war in Ukraine rages on while China continues a ""zero covid"" policy with draconian lockdowns in Shanghai. 

However, my personal belief is that investors are missing the forest for the trees. While the stock market will likely remain volatile in 2022, I believe we can expect a return to a bull market driven by a healthy and sustainable US expansion. I personally will be investing an unexpected windfall into the market over the next month. Below is a short list of my reasons, but I'd love to spark a discussion!

Note: all of these statistics, unless otherwise noted, apply to the US stock market / economy. However I am similarly bullish on other developed market economies (Japan, EU, etc.) given their attractive valuations. 

**Rationale:**

1. Strength of the underlying US economy
   1. The US added \~428,000 jobs in April across a broad array of industries led by, importantly, leisure &amp; hospitality + manufacturing, with a \~5.5% year over year increase in wages
   2. Consumers are estimated to have accumulated \~$2.7 trillion in excess savings over the pandemic
   3. A key point often overlooked is that Americans have gained at least $6 trillion (!) in real estate equity, and that figure excludes rental properties. More importantly, while stock ownership is heavily concentrated (the top \~10% richest US households own 90% of stocks) real estate holdings are distributed **relatively** more equally 
   4. The bottom line is that while inflation and the recent market correction is painful, American households (notably wealthier households) have ample resources to drive consumption
2. Corporate refinancings / corporate profits
   1. Corporations took advantage of the 2020 / 2021 drop in interest rates to issue record setting levels of cheap debt, \~$2.28 Trillion in 2020 and \~$3 trillion in 2021. The average corporate interest rate stands at 3.6%, which means corporations have both extended their debt maturities and reduced their interest expenses 
   2. Corporate profits are at record levels, in 2021, at \~$2.8 trillion
   3. Corporates are also sitting on mountains of cash, with \~$2.7 Trillion in cash or short term maturities
   4. Goldman Sachs estimates a record $1 trillion in share buybacks in 2022, a 12% increase over 2021. In the first 2 months of 2022 corporates have already authorized $238 billion in buybacks
   5. In some ways, the economic uncertainty may actually benefit investors. Companies may turn towards buybacks in lieu of investing in riskier projects (as seen in 2012 - 2015) 
3. Key Inflation drivers moderating 
   1. While the headline inflation is unarguably worrying, it's important to focus on what is driving inflation
   2. Much of the most recent increase in March headline inflation was driven by the spike in energy prices: gas, fuel oil, airline fares, electricity, etc. Another substantial portion was driven by the ongoing shortage of used / new cars due to the semiconductor shortage
   3. Perhaps more importantly, the ""comps"" used to calculate year over year inflation provide a natural tailwind as inflation began to accelerate in Q2 2021 
   4. One area of concern going forward is how much inflation we see due to shelter increases, which is just now starting to show up in the data (\~4.5% in March 2022). It's worth keeping in mind that rent is not directly measured by the CPI, only ""owners equivalent rent""
   5. The other wildcard is wage inflation leading to a ""wage price spiral"". I certainly acknowledge it's a risk, but it's worth keeping in mind that the US labor force is still down 1.2 million pre-pandemic levels (and that excludes the natural growth of the labor force for \~2 years). Another note is that the share of the economy going to labor has, surprisingly, declined. 
   6. I suspect we will continue to draw more workers into the economy as pandemic fears continue to recede, child care becomes more stable, and higher wages lure back ""retired"" workers. I also think much of the recent wage inflation is a one-off step-up to a de facto ""minimum wage"" increase to $15 driven by social pressure and a recalculation of the benefits of retention by large corporate employers. 
4. Medium term resolution of key global issues 
   1. I have no military background, so I'll avoid speculating on the tragic invasion of Ukraine by Russia. My only comment is that the consensus view, after wildly overestimating Russian's military prowess, seems to be that Russian military power is rapidly eroding. The pivot from Kyiv to the Donbas region seems to suggest more limited Russian objectives. From a strictly economic point of view, leaving aside the vast human cost and misery, my view is that the bad news is ""priced in"" and that further developments are likely to the upside (negotiations between Ukraine / Russia, more limited official objectives from Putin, etc.) 
   2. In a similar vein China's zero covid policy and draconian lockdown has both lowered Chinese GDP and snarled further supply chain issues. Again, my only opinion here is that the bad news is ""priced in"". If we look forward, it's likely that either China will successfully control the Covid outbreaks or, alternatively, will join the rest of the world in a mitigation strategy after the 20th Annual Party Congress when President Xi feels more secure. 
5. Extreme pessimism 
   1. 53% of investors in the AII survey indicate they are bearish, 20% higher than historical averages. Likewise consumer surveys also indicate significant pessimism 
   2. I personally think the recent sell-off is far too broad based, and has affected healthy, relatively inflation resistant equity sectors (e.g. financials, CPG, etc.) 
6. Painful, but healthy, tech stock reset 
   1. Somewhere around 25% of the market cap of the S&amp;P 500 is the ""FAANG"" stocks (although now Microsoft &amp; Tesla instead of Netflix). The US tech sector is suffering from 2 distinct, but intertwined phenomena. 
   2. The first is that ""trees don't grow to the sky"". Netflix &amp; Meta (Facebook), for example, are naturally reaching limits to their breakneck growth as they already dominate their respective, maturing industries. Likewise Amazon and other e-commerce / digitalization companies are showing sharply slower growth as demand was pulled forward and intensified by the pandemic. As their growth naturally slows, we can expect investors to start valuing them more as mature, profitable enterprises (e.g. Meta now trades at a PE of 16, not far off from JP Morgan at a PE of \~10) 
   3. The second is that investors have basically been pattern matching every ""tech"" company to Alphabet (Google), Meta, etc. True tech companies are defined by network effects, i.e. the marginal cost of serving the next customer trends towards zero. Now some companies only have partial network effects, e.g. Apple drives most of its revenue from hardware, but that hardware ecosystem drives massive network effects with its App store. But other companies are clearly not this pattern, e.g. Palantir relies heavily on professional services (often labeled as ""sales &amp; marketing expenses"") to secure its next customer. 
   4. Low interest rates also drove immense interest in Venture Capital, with new players like Tiger Global (who raised an additional $11B in Feb 2022) deploying billions into startups. Many of the ""mega fundraising rounds"" of late 2020 - early 2022 drove unrealistic valuations. E.g. Bolt, a fintech, raised $355M at an $11B valuation with revenues of \~$40M. Fast, another Fintech, raised a $102M series B round with revenues of low six figures. 
   5. The bottom line is we are seeing a healthy, if potentially overreactive, correction to growth stocks. The next year will likely be painful for late stage startups, particularly those who are not cash flow positive. I suspect we will start to hear layoff announcements at these startups and a slowdown in hiring at the large tech companies (e.g. Meta just repoted a hiring freeze)

**Conclusion**:

As an interesting historical parallel, inflation spiked heavily in the US in 1946-1948 after WW2. I suspect  that much of that inflation was driven by a large increase in consumer spending demand and constrained supply due to a lag in the economy returning to a normal, civilian oriented approach.  

I think the current US economy is also in a current state of transition. While the markets will likely remain volatile for some time, I personally believe inflation has already peaked. Over the next year companies will deploy this massive cash reserves in share buybacks. Consumers, particularly the affluent, will leverage both their accumulated savings and vast increase in real estate equity to drive consumption. Hopefully workers will continue to see pay raises, which with inflation moderating, will turn into **real** wage gains.

t3_ultmzk|1652109689|investing|At what level will we see capitulation?|"Buying the CoVID flash crash of 2020 turned out to (at least shortly after) be a really good dip buying opportunity.

everybody seems to know how much the Fed will do quantitive tightening per month, but nobody seems to be aware of any of their targets long-term. For example, we don’t know if they’ll be able to keep the course of unwinding $100 billion a month for six months, eight months, 12 months, 60 months.

their balance sheet was a little bit below $4 trillion before the pandemic, and it’s now currently closer to 9 trillion. There’s no data to prove this but I’m going to guess the Fed obviously has a desire to lower their balance sheet, and pre-pandemic levels could potentially be a good target. Meaning they have to unroll about $5 trillion, which at current rates would take about 50 months.

there is nothing that states all stock market price discovery should break over this. There’s nothing to say that companies will not make and grow earnings.

However, we’re obviously going through what seems like a correction. The joke around this sub has always been, if too many people are buying we’re at the top, and when people start making posts like this, we should be closer to the bottom.

all jokes aside since I’m not really interested in calling bottoms or timing or anything like that, I’m just curious where a “sane” level of “downtrend” makes sense.

do we revert to the mean of 15x P/E? i’m not exactly sure what price that puts us at. I will do the math later. that would be with trailing 12 month earnings, and if 20% of the companies in the S&amp;P (random number) fail to grow or even start to go backwards earnings wise, the valuation projection quickly becomes useless.

this form really hates to say numbers. They love by the dip. I love by the dip. I see how time in the market works. I’m not trying to time any markets.

t3_ul837l|1652034997|investing|Dividend vs. non-dividend assets|"After a bit of reading on dividend investing pros/cons I noticed that on many FIRE (financial independance) subs, dividend returning assests are seen as a poor hold compared to assets that internally reinvest (e.g. stock buybacks). It is suggested that you can just sell stocks when you need the money (instead of having the dividend return). The logic behind this would be that dividends are seen as your investment getting cut and losing value as much as the dividend. 

There is one thing I fail to understand with this non-dividend ""growth"" strategy: 

Upon payout of dividend, the stock normally loses as much value as dividend that is issued (e.g. 1 dollar drop per 1 dollar dividend). However, stocks are (in general) valued for their (future) earnings, which do not change upon issuing of dividends. So basically there is no reason to value the stock differently after the dividend payout (except for its change in cash position, which is even likely to increase as dividends are usually only part of the profit made). Therefore, IMO, dividend is just a payout that you get from holding the stock, contributing to growth of your investment (rather than your investment losing value due to the cash payout). 

Also, stocks are valued based on earnings and investor sentiment. Dividends are a payout that is (often) determined based on company performance, and are therefore not affected by investor sentiment. This makes dividends a more reliable return  than holding the stocks itself. 

Lets have a look at NFLX and META, both have no dividend and perform stock buybacks, however market sentiment destroyed those stocks while earnings are still pretty decent. In case of a dividend, the recepient would have been able to profit from this, and potentially use the dividend to buy more of the stock at a discount (or use the money for something else). While in the case with the stock buyback the investor is not profiting as the market sentiment determines the stockprice and no funds are relocated to the shareholder as direct payout. This seems to me that stock buybacks are mainly beneficial for the company itself and not necessarily for the shareholder (especially since companies can in some cases later on sell their shares again to raise funds).

Ford Motor is selling 8 million of its Rivian Automotive shares, with the insider lockup for the stock of the once high-flying electric vehicle maker is set to expire on Sunday, sources told CNBC’s David Faber.

The automaker currently owns 102 million shares of Rivian. Ford will be selling the shares through Goldman Sachs, sources said.

The lockup defines a period of time after a company has gone public when early investors and company insiders cannot sell their shares. That ensures the IPO is carried out in an orderly manner and does not flood the market with additional shares.

 

JPMorgan Chase also plans to sell a Rivian share block of between 13 million and 15 million for an unknown seller, sources told Faber. Both blocks of stocks are priced at $26.90 a share.

Here are my thoughts for Fiverr:

Fiverr's **revenue** has been growing for about **50%** YoY for the last 4 years and was **$298M** in 2021.

They state that **cost of revenue** was **$52M** so they had a nice **83% gross margin** and **$246M gross profits**.

Their **net income** was **-$65M** mostly because they spent **$159M** on marketing.

According to their shareholder letter, they get about **$1** in same-year revenue for every **$1** they spent on marketing. And then about **$1** every year. Probably because the customers who stay on spend more, so they make up for the churn. At least for the short time they are around, average yearly spent per customer has stayed roughly flat.

Given this retention and the high gross margin makes it very likely, that those marketing dollars are well spent. As the marketing investment has a positive ROI after 2 years already.

Ok, let's look into the future.

Say their **growth** in the next 5 years will be **25%,** half of what it was over the last 4 years. Then revenue would be $298\*1.25\^5 = **$909M**. If their gross margin would still be 83%, then their gross profit would be around $755M. Let's imagine they stopped all marketing at that point. And let them burn another $100M on fixed costs. Then we are at **$655M** **earnings**.

Give that a **pe ratio** of 10 and the **market cap** would be **$6.6B**.

Right now, their market  cap is **$1.73B**

Going from $1.73B to $6.6B in 5 years is a **ROI** of **31%.**

""Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.

The charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.

Given the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.

Despite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.

“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”""

[Edit] lots of people asking why this is illegal.

Without getting into the specifics of calculating the discount rate, different sources give different justifications for discounting future cash flows. Within the same article, [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) describes the discount rate as both:
* an adjustment for the declining time value of money (inflation?)
* a valuation of the investment's opportunity cost (the missed income that could have been made from alternative investments?).

Although the former explanation makes more sense to me, the financial press often fill the void between earnings reports with articles about how the Fed's changes to the risk-free rate of return^b affect stock valuations. **Is the discount rate most influenced by inflation or by the risk-free rate of return?**

(a) I'm using a broad definition of cash flow to describe all kinds of investments. A more specific definition of cash flow would be earnings for non-income-yielding equities, retained earnings plus dividends for income-yielding equities, and interest for debts.

(b) The risk-free rate of return is usually taken to be the yield on either the thirteen-week US Treasury bill or the ten-year US Treasury note. Turning the dials on the global money machine is a perk of being the back-to-back World War champion."|0.73|13|0|13|['US Treasury', 'Fed']

I got lucky as I thought Covid would be resolved in months not years.


I rolled my 401K into an IRA, so don't have access to my statements from 2008/9. I did shift a little to bonds at some point, likely balancing what was the 100% stock portfolio of a then 35 year old.  That is by far the worst period I've experienced, and it is not even close.

&gt;Traders worried about the Federal Reserve’s ability to tamp down ultra-hot inflation without sacrificing economic growth now have an exchange-traded fund to fall back on.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Merk Stagflation ETF (ticker [STGF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/STGF)) tracks a portfolio divided between 55%-85% U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and between 5%-15% real estate, gold and oil. The ETF charges a 0.45% expense ratio and will rebalance as needed to keep those weightings.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trading in STGF kicks off hours before the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points -- the biggest move since 2000 -- with at least two more supersized hikes priced in this year. While the hottest inflation prints in four decades fueled the Fed’s hawkish pivot, it’s a difficult needle to thread as the pace of growth cools and recession warnings ring louder. That’s fanned fears about stagflation -- a toxic mix of rising costs, falling employment and slow growth -- though the labor market remains hot and the American consumer has been resilient.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the launch is well-timed, ETF Think Tank’s Cinthia Murphy questioned why it doesn’t have a higher weighting to commodities.  
&gt;  
&gt;“As a general thought, the idea of a stagflation ETF is cool -- it’s first of a kind and it offers advisors and investors the ability to access four different assets they might not own otherwise in one single wrapper,” said Murphy, director of research at ETF Think Tank. “I find it somewhat surprising that this ETF would not have a broader allocation to commodities.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (SCHP), which STGF holds for TIPS exposure, has declined roughly 7.6% so far in 2022 even as price pressures surge. That’s outperformed the S&amp;P 500’s more than 12% drop and the 20% plunge in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), but that lags other inflation-hedging strategies.  
&gt;  
&gt;But while there is interest-rate risk, TIPS still are the “most direct instrument to help keep up with inflation over time,” according to STGF portfolio manager Axel Merk.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There are of course other choices one could have made,” Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments, wrote in an email. “Our goal is to provide a focused tool for investors to have in their tool-kit as they navigate what may be a stagflationary environment. Our goal was not to provide a kitchen sink.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But if the U.S. truly enters a stagflationary period, there won’t be any investing opportunities, Christopher Ailman of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. Though such an environment is still a low risk, it’s one worth watching as wages rise and supply chains remain clogged.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m not going to say the word stagflation,” Ailman, chief investment officer of second-largest U.S. pension fund, said in an interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference. “It’s still a low risk, but it’s got to be in the vocabulary for next year. There is nothing you can invest in, there is no opportunity when you’re in a stagflation environment.”"|0.88|98|0|98|['the Milken Institute Global Conference', 'Fed', 'STGF', 'ETF Think Tank’s', 'Merk Investments', 'SCHP', 'Treasury', 'ETF Think Tank', 'the Federal Reserve’s', 'Bloomberg Television', 'U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities', 'the California State Teachers’ Retirement System', 'Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF']

Global bond markets have suffered unprecedented losses since peaking last year, as central banks including the Federal Reserve look to tighten policy to combat surging inflation.

The Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, a benchmark for government and corporate debt total returns, has fallen 11% from a high in January 2021. That’s the biggest decline from a peak in data stretching back to 1990, surpassing a 10.8% drawdown during the financial crisis in 2008. It equates to a drop in the index market value of about $2.6 trillion, worse than about $2 trillion in 2008.
 

While there were signs the brutal selloff was easing on Wednesday, rising inflationary pressure around the world is fueling concerns about the ability of the global economy to weather any sustained period of higher financing costs. For investors, it means the allure of holding debt -- even safe government bonds -- is diminishing given how sensitive valuations are to interest rates, a measure referred to as duration.

“The safe haven attributes of Treasuries have been undermined when one adds duration risk to the equation,” said Winson Phoon, head of fixed income research at Maybank Securites Pte. Ltd. 

That’s a blow to money managers accustomed to years of consistent gains, backstopped by loose monetary policy. The slump also poses a particular threat to the expanding elderly population in many major economies, given retirees are often heavily reliant on fixed-income investments. 

The Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points last week, and Chair Jerome Powell said this week it is prepared to increase them by a half percentage-point at its next meeting if needed. His hawkish tone prompted traders to rapidly ratchet up estimates for how aggressively the Fed will tighten monetary policy this year, with money markets pricing in the equivalent of seven more quarter-point hikes by the end of 2022.

“The headwinds for fixed income remain heavy,” said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore. “Investors will need to recalibrate return expectations and be nimble to exploit market dislocations.”

The yield on 10-year Treasuries slipped two basis points to 2.36% as of 6:28 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, after surging to the highest level since 2019. Spanish and Italian bonds led the advance in Europe, with their benchmark rates falling three basis points.

Credit Risk

Higher borrowing costs risk further damping the return on debt, eroded by the fastest pace of consumer-price increases in decades. Soaring commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could worsen the outlook. Corporate bonds are particularly vulnerable to mounting stagflation threats, as slowing economic growth also raises credit risks.

Companies in the U.S. and Europe are set to avoid defaults thanks to healthy balance sheets and a manageable debt maturity schedule, Amanda Lynam, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Still, she sees the euro-denominated market as slightly more exposed if geopolitical tensions stay elevated for longer.

Global equities, meanwhile, are nursing losses of about 6% this year, even as stocks have bounced back in recent days as more investors bet they will help hedge against inflation. The retreat in both fixed-income and stock markets in 2022 is upending the dynamics of a classic 60/40 portfolio that is meant to balance out any losses from riskier share markets with the more stable cash flow of bonds.

The meltdown in global debt markets is a reminder of the Fed’s tightening cycle in 2018, though the broad global bond index wound up losing only 1.2% for that full year. But unlike four years ago, price pressures are now much stronger and the global supply chain is beleaguered. 

For emerging Asia, the threat of stagnant growth and accelerating inflation adds to the upside risk for yields, according to Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. 

“We are likely to continue seeing upward pressure on yields as we expect monetary tightening in a number of Asian economies to start in” the second half of the year, said Jennifer Kusuma, a senior Asia rates strategist at the bank.

Data on the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index before 1999 is monthly rather than daily and the constituents and duration of aggregate indexes fluctuate. Fixed-income investors can still make money by betting against bonds.

With Europe seeing outsized weakness due to the Russia Ukraine conflict, energy shortages causing problems globally, and China going full zero tolerance on Covid, I suppose it's not that surprising that the USD has appreciated against peers.

Then you take all of that and add the fact that the Fed is raising rates while other central banks are remaining either neutral, are raising rates slower, or are still providing accommodation (japan) and it's a bit of a perfect storm for USD strength.

The current labor climate and supply chain issues have been ongoing for more than a year, so that shouldn’t be new news to investors. 

As a long term investor, I’ll continue to buy and weather the storm. But, again, my point is that, as I understand it, the volatility over the past year is historically anomalous and I was curious if anyone could put it into perspective for me."|0.79|1548|0|1548|[]
t3_uiysd7|1651761179|investing|Is this a good investment opportunity?|I’ve been watching Iteris (NASDAQ: ITI) for a while now. It seems like every week there is news about the company being awarded a new contract. There have been 2 or 3 announcements of new contracts just in the last week. I don’t recall seeing any negative news about the company. And yet the stock price has fallen almost 60% over the past year. The stock analyses that I can find seem to be like luke warm at best on the company. Could this be a good investment opportunity? What else should I be looking at with the stock?|0.45|0|0|0|['NASDAQ']
t3_uiyjl2|1651760497|investing|Investing tracking with excel help. Getting stock weighting|"In excel I'm trying to make a file that uses a formula to tell me how many number of shares of each stock I would need, in order to keep an equal weight. The problem is, there is a max investment amount that I can't go over. I manually did it for now but excel can update the stock prices and I would like the weighting to update with it. Right now it finds the average to keep the weight the same but it's rounding up over the investment amount I'm inputting. Anyone good with excel have an idea on how to put a hard ceiling in this formula? I could have all the shares round down but that will leave a decent gap between the amount I want to invest how excel is  telling me to. 
If you have any questions or any advice I'd love to hear it."|0.7|4|0|4|[]
